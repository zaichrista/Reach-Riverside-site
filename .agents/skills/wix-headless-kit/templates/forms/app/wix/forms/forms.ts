// Wix Forms schema reads — the only file that touches a raw Form on this transport. Returns flat
// FormDto / FormFieldDto from ./types. The flattening rules live in ./forms-core (shared with the
// REST twin in templates/forms/rest/); this file is the transport only. Copy as-is; extend by
// adding functions.
//
// The reads go over `wixFetch` (the SDK's own authenticated fetch), NOT the `forms` module of
// @wix/forms: that generated module is 15 MB. Bundled server-side it pushes a Wix deploy past its
// size limit (HTTP 413 on release); bundled client-side every visitor downloads it. The
// submissions module (./submissions.ts) is 100 KB and stays on the SDK.
//
// The visitor token is enough, and the spec says otherwise. Every schema read is listed under
// the owner scope `SCOPE.FORMS.VIEW-FORM`, and returns 200 on an anonymous visitor: Wix grants
// implicit visitor access so a published site can render its own forms. Do NOT add a backend, a
// connector token, or auth.elevate to make a form load.
