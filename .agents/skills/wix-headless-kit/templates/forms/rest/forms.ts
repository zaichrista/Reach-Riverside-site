// Form-schema reads over REST — the twin of app/wix/forms/forms.ts. Same exports, same FormDto; the
// flattening rules come from forms-core (the SAME file the SDK transport uses, deployed flat next
// to this one by deploy.mjs --stack static), so this file is only the transport: one fetch per
// function. Both calls run with the visitor token — the schema read is listed under an owner scope
// and still returns 200 to an anonymous visitor, so a published site can render its own forms.
// Porting: keep the paths, keep the query, port the core once.
