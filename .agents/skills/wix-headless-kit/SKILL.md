# Wix Headless Kit

Build a Wix Headless site on **shipped, verified code instead of authoring the integration**.
Each vertical ships the integration itself — a typed data layer, hooks, components, pages, and a
seed script that are already correct. On a stack that runs it (Wix-managed Astro, any React
project) the code is **deployed** and the agent's job narrows to brand, layout, copy, and wiring.
On a stack that can't run it (a static site with no bundler, a server-rendered app in another
language) the same code is the **reference**: its REST twin deploys for the browser side, and the
rules it encodes are what the agent ports. Either way the decisions live in the code; don't
re-litigate them.

**Scope.** Tuned for Wix-managed Astro, and each vertical ships *one* shape of its solution. Use
it as-is when the brief doesn't contradict it. When the brief asks for something that shape
doesn't express — or once the site exists and the work turns to managing or extending it — that's
`wix-docs` and `wix-manage`, not a workaround here.

## The model

- **Shipped code is the implementation.** Every vertical ships under `templates/<vertical>/` in
  the skill's repository, not in the skill folder: `node <SKILL_ROOT>/install/templates.mjs`
  fetches all of it once into `<SKILL_ROOT>/templates/` (a second) and prints the path; every
  script below fetches it itself when the folder is missing. The folder stays with the project
  (only the composed `project/` scaffolds are left out of its repository), so a later session
  reads the version the project was built from. Each vertical holds:
  - `app/` — the framework-agnostic core (TypeScript): a data layer that returns **plain,
    serializable DTOs** (images resolved to https URLs, prices pre-formatted), React hooks, and
    routing-free headless components. Works in Astro islands, Vite SPAs, and Next.
  - `app-astro/` — a thin Astro overlay: SSR pages that fetch via the core and pass DTOs to
    islands, with owner-editable item-page SEO pre-wired.
  - `seed/` — a build-time REST seed script (plain-data plan in, created content out) plus its
    `SEED.md` contract.
  - `INSTRUCTIONS.md` — the vertical's playbook: file map, what you build, hard rules.
  - `project/` — the vertical composed into the Wix CLI's blank Astro scaffold, with its
    lockfile: what `wix create` copies for a new site, so the first vertical installs without
    resolving.
- **One auth seam.** All shipped code calls Wix through `src/wix/sdk.ts`: on Wix-managed Astro
  auth is ambient (no client, no id); on any other React setup the same file runs a manual
  visitor client off the public client id in `src/wix/config.ts`. The deploy step configures
  this — nothing to wire by hand.
- **Data as-is; presentation is yours.** The data layer, hooks, and cart chrome are wired
  as-is — never rewrite their internals, re-route them through API routes, or re-derive a
  request shape. When the brief needs something they don't express, read the shipped file that
  owns it and confirm the contract with `wix-docs`; never infer one from generated SDK types,
  package files, or `node_modules`. A normal caller-permitted operation belongs in a new
  data-layer function. A privileged operation belongs in a validated server endpoint — see
  `templates/shared/CUSTOM_OPERATIONS.md`. The presentation **doesn't ship**: the vertical's
  INSTRUCTIONS names the surfaces you design and implement yourself on the shipped hooks,
  with a skeleton carrying each surface's contract (for storefront: the shop and PDP pages
  with their islands, and home).
- **NEVER work from training data or memory about the Wix APIs.** Not a URL, a path, a version,
  a header, a field name, a filter key, or a body. Every Wix call you make or write — in the
  frontend, in a seed, in a build-time read of a site — comes from the official Wix skills
  installed here, the code they deployed first, or, when they do not cover the call, from the
  official Wix documentation through `wix-docs`. Read it there first, then write the call.
  **The test, before every request:** the exact path and body appear in the output of a file
  read or a docs search you ran in this session, and you copy them from that output. Anything
  else is memory: a file whose output was cut short before the call, a source you remember
  reading earlier, a call built by changing part of one you did find. A guessed call that
  returns 400 or nothing is not a step toward the
  answer; it is the failure this rule exists to prevent, trying the next variant is still
  guessing, and an empty or error reply to a call that failed the test tells you about the
  call, never about the site. Keep errors visible while a call is unconfirmed: no `2>/dev/null`,
  no `| echo`. The shipped code is tested against live sites; a body that looks similar is the
  one that returns nothing, and the API rarely says why.
- **Never mock, fail loudly, purchases via Wix.** Live data or an honest empty state; surfaced
  errors, not swallowed ones; checkout/purchase always through the Wix redirect session.
- **Optional capabilities are deployed from the plan.** A vertical can opt into a shared
  capability without copying sensitive code. For a normal file upload, add a named
  `capabilities.mediaUpload.policies` entry to the plan; Fast ships its client helper, Astro
  endpoint, dependencies, and generated policy module once. Read
  `templates/shared/CUSTOM_OPERATIONS.md` before choosing it. The agent wires the helper to
  the product UI; it never authors or widens the endpoint. For a site-wide search (a header box
  with suggestions, a `/search?q=` page over the deployed verticals' products, services, posts
  and events), add a `capabilities.siteSearch` entry; Fast ships its data layer, stores, hooks,
  components and search page once. Enabling it means the Wix Site Search app is installed on the
  site by the seed step (`install: true`; the capability's `seed/install.mjs`, run after the
  content seed) — the index fills within about half a minute of the install. Playbook:
  `templates/shared/capabilities/site-search/INSTRUCTIONS.md`.

## The run

Needed throughout: Node ≥ 22.12 (Astro 7; the Wix CLI alone runs on 20.11), git, a logged-in Wix CLI (`npx @wix/cli@latest whoami`;
`npx @wix/cli@latest login` is a device-code flow: surface the URL and code to the user, never
read tokens into context), and the two companion skills installed beside this one, `wix-docs`
and `wix-manage`. `node <SKILL_ROOT>/install/bootstrap.mjs` checks the CLI and runs the login
when there is none; the cold-start page, `https://www.wix.com/skills/headless-cold-start/headless-kit.md`,
gets a machine with none of this, the skills included, to that point. In a folder that
already holds a `wix.config.json`, `node <SKILL_ROOT>/install/context.mjs` first: it runs
`wix env pull` when `.env.local` is missing and prints the folder's **shape** (`folder.shape`, the
cases of step 3, with the `next` for each) and the two identities a project has — the deploy site
(the config, where `wix release` goes) and the content site (the env, whose app the SDK client runs
as and whose dashboard manages the business). They are one site, except on a **migration preview**
(`guides/migration.md`), where the env names the site being migrated. Every script here reads that
context; the site a call targets is never guessed from the config alone. Then fetch the shipped
code once: `node <SKILL_ROOT>/install/templates.mjs`. It prints the folder;
the `templates/…` paths below are relative to `<SKILL_ROOT>`, where it lands.
`node <SKILL_ROOT>/install/check.mjs` says whether the skill or its templates have a newer version
and prints the update commands; it changes nothing.

Throughout any run: if the user asks to send feedback to Wix, complains or gets frustrated, or the
run hits friction of any kind: anything that cost more turns than it should have, whether or not
it ended in an error (a confusing error, a doc gap, a seed that had to be re-run, a shipped file
that did not cover the brief, a playbook line you had to read the source to understand, a call you
had to work out by trial, a workaround you had to invent, a slow or flaky step, a platform gate),
offer to relay it to Wix per `<SKILL_ROOT>/guides/feedback.md`. Default to offering rather than waiting to be asked; send
only after an explicit yes, never automatically. Step 5 ends with the same self-check.

1. **Resolve the stack.** Default is **Wix-managed Astro** — take it unless the user names
   another framework or the directory already holds one. Then, by what the shipped code can run
   there:
   - **React** (Vite, Next, …) runs everything shipped — data layer, hooks, components:
     `--stack react`. The agent's own files may be JS; the shipped files are TypeScript and
     build untouched inside a JS project — never strip them by hand; if the brief wants no
     TypeScript anywhere, say the shipped code cannot meet that and ask before going on.
     A named framework is scaffolded with its own command
     first (`npm create vite@latest`, …), then step 3 runs in that folder.
   - **Another bundled JS framework** (Vue, Svelte, Solid, plain Vite): the data layer and the
     framework-free stores run (`src/wix/` has no React in it), the React hooks and components
     don't apply: `--stack lib`. The agent binds the stores and writes its framework's components
     against the same contracts.
   - **No bundler, or another language** — a static site (plain HTML/CSS/JS), a server-rendered
     app (Flask, Laravel, Rails, …): **reference mode** (its section below, and
     `<SKILL_ROOT>/guides/reference-mode.md`). Nothing from `app/` deploys; the REST layer
     deploys for the browser side, and the server side ports it for its reads.

   **What Wix hosting takes, and what each stack needs to be released there.** `wix release`
   uploads the folder named in `wix.config.json` (`site.outputDirectory`) and serves it as
   files — no SPA fallback, no directory index, no rewrites: `/` and real files resolve, a clean
   client-side route answers 404 when loaded directly or shared. Server code runs only as a
   Cloudflare Workers build, declared as `outputDirectory: { client, server }`.
   - **Managed Astro** is the stack the Wix CLI scaffolds: the Wix Astro integration
     (`@wix/astro`, ambient auth), the hosting adapter (`@wix/astro-wix-hosting-adapter`, the
     Workers build), `@astrojs/react` with React 18 for the shipped components, and in
     `astro.config.mjs` `integrations: [wix(), react()]`, `adapter: wixHostingAdapter()`,
     `output: "server"`, `security: { checkOrigin: false }`, `image.domains` with
     `static.wixstatic.com`. An Astro project made without the CLI has none of that; add it
     before deploying, and the site serves every route. The integration supports **Astro 5**: a
     project on another major is pinned to 5 first, or connected as a React host.
   - **React and other bundlers** release their own build as files. So routes are hash routes,
     or one emitted HTML file per route linked by its file name — decided before the first route
     is written; any URL handed to Wix as a return target must be one the host serves. Verify by
     loading a deep URL directly, not by navigating from `/`.
   - **A framework whose build is a server** (Next, Nuxt, Remix, SvelteKit, …) releases only as a
     static export (files, the rule above applies), or as a Workers build through
     `outputDirectory: { client, server }`; otherwise it is self-hosted, with its domain added to
     the OAuth app's allowed domains before checkout can return to it.
   - **Static** (no build): `outputDirectory` points at the folder the pages live in; a route is a
     page plus a query-string slug (reference mode).
2. **The seed plan.** The brief decides what is seeded; a site this run makes always opens with content:

   | the brief | the plan |
   |---|---|
   | supplies the content in any form: a CSV, JSON or spreadsheet, a list in the prompt, a PDF price list, a folder of photos and a text file, a link to their current catalog, anything that names the content | that IS the plan: map it into `plan.json` per `templates/shared/SUPPLIED-CONTENT.md` and the vertical's `SEED.md` ("Supplied content"), every entry, names and prices verbatim, their images and no others |
   | describes the content without listing it ("a store for hand-poured candles, four of them", "a dozen FAQ questions in three groups") | draft a plan from the description per the vertical's `SEED.md` (read only that for this; save `INSTRUCTIONS.md` for step 4) |
   | says nothing about content ("build me a store") | on a site this run makes (create, adopt) draft a plan per the vertical's `SEED.md` so the site opens with content, and say in the closing message that it is placeholder content and where to replace it; on a site that existed before the run (attach, iterate, published-static, migrate) no plan and no seed: the site holds what the owner put there |

   **An existing site has no plan of its own**: when the brief names a site by its id, or the
   folder's config does, the site holds the content already; the frontend reads what is there
   (step 3's attach path), and only content the brief supplies or describes is added to it.
3. **Set up the project, in its folder** — one deterministic call, the same for an empty folder
   and for a project already on disk; **the folder decides** what it does, from five file facts:
   `wix.config.json`, its `site.outputDirectory`, the migration variables in `.env.local`,
   `package.json`, `index.html`. `node <SKILL_ROOT>/install/context.mjs` prints the shape it reads
   and the `next` for it. **The brief is the instruction**: what it asks to switch on is installed
   on the site the folder names, without asking again. Ask only when acting would create a second
   site for a folder that already has one, or when a cleanup seems needed.

   ```bash
   node <SKILL_ROOT>/install/setup.mjs --vertical <vertical>[,<vertical>…] [--plan plan.json] [--business-name "<Brand>"] [--stack <stack>]
   ```

   Name every vertical the brief needs in this one call (a store with member accounts is
   `storefront,members`): the first one's template scaffolds the project; the others deploy in the
   same call, so the one install covers them all. A vertical added after the install has started
   costs a second install.

   | the folder holds | shape | what setup does | seeded by setup |
   |---|---|---|---|
   | nothing, or loose files (a CSV, a brief) | **empty** → create | `wix create` with the vertical's composed template, here; `--business-name` names the site | **yes**, from `--plan` |
   | a frontend, no config (a `package.json`, or `index.html` at the root: someone's Astro, Vite, Next, plain HTML) | **project** → adopt | `init` in place gives it a new, empty site, then deploys; `--stack` from step 1 is required; make the project what that stack needs on Wix hosting (step 1) before or right after | **yes**, from `--plan` |
   | a config whose `.env.local` declares an active editor migration (`EDITOR_MIGRATION_STATUS=ACTIVE`), with or without the blank Astro starter the download carries | **migration** → migrate | the shipped code into the starter (or the composed template around a bare config), deployed with the migrated site's app as the client, the install starts; `ready_for_brand_layer` says `mode: "migrate"`, the parent as `siteId`, the child as `deploySiteId` (`guides/migration.md`) | no, ever |
   | a config, no frontend | **config-only** → refuses | the site exists and has no frontend yet: `attach.mjs` (below) takes the site from the config, reuses its hosting, scaffolds and deploys | no |
   | a config and a frontend (a `package.json`, or `index.html` inside the folder `site.outputDirectory` names) | **wix-project** → refuses | iterate: never scaffold, `init` or reseed. `deploy.mjs <vertical…> --stack <stack>` adds a solution (the client id comes from `.env.local`, the config as the fallback), then ONE `npm install`; a change is file edits; then release | no |
   | a config, `index.html` at the root, no `package.json` (a site published through the drop flow and downloaded) | **published-static** | the config's site, no `init`: `site/` becomes the upload, the REST layer deploys into `site/js/wix/`; the `next` says to move the pages, styles and assets in; release keeps the URL | no |

   **Setup seeds only a site it created in this run** (create and adopt: the site is empty by
   construction, so the plan from step 2 goes in with the one call). A site that existed before
   the run holds content the run did not make: read it first with the vertical's
   `seed/read-site.mjs`, then, when the brief supplies or describes content, run the vertical's
   seed module yourself with a plan (from the project root:
   `node <SKILL_ROOT>/templates/<vertical>/seed/seed-<vertical>.mjs plan.json`). Seeds are
   additive and idempotent by name; nothing on a site is ever deleted or overwritten.

   - The brief names a site by id → not this call: read `<SKILL_ROOT>/guides/existing-site.md`
     and follow it (read the site, then `attach.mjs`, which does what setup does against the
     site given; self-hosting and a project already on disk are in there too).

   `--vertical` is required and picks which shipped code deploys AND which seed runs. The
   `ready_for_brand_layer` event says `mode` (`create`, `adopt`, `migrate`, `published-static`),
   `shape`, the stack, and the `next` for that stack, including how it releases.

   setup scaffolds with `--skip-git`: it composes its own steps and leaves version control to
   you / the enclosing repo, so it does **not** create the scaffold's usual git repo + initial
   commit (which would otherwise become a nested-repo gitlink if the project lands inside a repo).

   The project is created **in the current directory** — the folder the entry had you work from,
   which already holds the installed skills — so the project is self-contained and a later session
   opened in it finds everything. It refuses if the folder already holds a file the scaffold would
   write. `--subfolder` creates it in a new folder named after the business instead, for a current
   folder that must stay as it is; the skills then sit one level above the project.

   It emits one JSON event per line and returns in **~35s**: **scaffolds** the project from the
   vertical's composed template (`wix create` copies it: the code and its lockfile arrive with
   the scaffold), **deploys** whatever the folder still lacks (patching `package.json` with every
   dependency the code imports), then **starts two detached background jobs** — the dependency install (`npm ci --ignore-scripts || npm install --ignore-scripts`)
   and the **seed** — whose logs and completion markers are in the events. The final
   `ready_for_brand_layer` event carries the project dir, siteId, ready-made dashboard links,
   and both markers. Relay notable events. On an `error` event, recover just that step via the
   manual path below, then continue.

   **Recovering one step, or adding a solution later:** the pieces run on their own from the
   project root — `node <SKILL_ROOT>/install/deploy.mjs <vertical…> --stack <stack>` (the client
   id is read from `wix.config.json`), ONE `npm ci --ignore-scripts || npm install
   --ignore-scripts` (**never a second npm install concurrently**: two npms in one
   `node_modules` race and redo each other's work; setup already started one — wait on its
   marker), the vertical's seed module per its `seed/SEED.md`.
   A code change on an existing project is done when it is **released** (step 5) and the live
   URL shows it — not when a dev server or a local build shows it. A management change (a
   recipe against the site) needs no release; the frontend reads it live.

4. **Design and build the presentation while the install finishes** — in the project dir from
   the `ready_for_brand_layer` event, per the vertical's `INSTRUCTIONS.md`: set the `@theme`
   tokens, brand the chrome, and implement the vertical's creative surfaces yourself on the
   shipped hooks (for storefront: your product card + grid, shop surface, PDP surface, and the
   home page) — designed to fit the brief, not copied from the reference components. Read the
   INSTRUCTIONS and the shared floors — `templates/shared/DESIGN.md` +
   `templates/shared/CONTENT.md` — now (not earlier — their contracts matter only from this
   step on); the hook/DTO
   contracts are inlined there, so don't open the shipped files themselves. **Author your
   surfaces in as few messages as possible** — batch multiple Write calls in one message
   (components are independent files); don't pay a round-trip per file.
   If the brief needs a core operation that shipped code does not cover, read
   `templates/shared/CUSTOM_OPERATIONS.md` before writing it. Use one documented path and
   implement it; do not reverse-engineer SDK internals.
5. **When both background jobs have completed** — the install's marker
   (`node_modules/.package-lock.json`) and the seed's (`.seed-exit`) both exist — **verify the
   seed succeeded** (`.seed-exit` contains `0`; `seed-result.json` has the created counts for
   your summary — if non-zero, read `seed.log` and re-run the seed module manually). Those two
   seed files exist **only when setup started the seed** (attach runs none: only the install
   marker is waited on). When you ran `seed-store.mjs`
   yourself (adopt, iterate and published-static runs, reference mode), there is no marker to wait for: the process's
   exit code is the result and its stdout is the JSON — wait on the process (a foreground run,
   or `wait` on its pid), not on a file. Then
   **build & release once** (managed), as the `next` of the `ready_for_brand_layer` event says
   for the stack: Astro → `npx @wix/cli@latest build` then `npx @wix/cli@latest release`;
   React or another bundler → the project's own build, then `npx @wix/cli@latest release` of
   the build folder named in `wix.config.json` (deep URLs must answer 200 directly, step 1);
   static → `release` alone. If the install failed, run it once more and then build. Don't
   build+release mid-flow; backend content is fetched at
   runtime, so a re-release never "refreshes" seeded data. The run is complete only when the
   site is released — close with the live URL and the dashboard link
   `https://manage.wix.com/dashboard/<siteId>` (the `siteId` of the `ready_for_brand_layer`
   event: on a migration preview that is the migrated site's dashboard, the release URL is the
   preview's, the original site is unchanged, and completing the migration is the user's next
   step in the Wix CLI once they approve — say all three). When the site takes money through
   hosted checkout (a cart, a paid booking or rental, tickets, plans, donations) and nothing says
   payments are already set up, say what a visitor meets at checkout until they are — "We
   can't accept online payments. Contact us for help with your order." — and hand the two links
   that fix it: **Accept payments** `https://manage.wix.com/dashboard/<siteId>/wix-cashier/payments`
   (connect a payment method; "manual payments" is enough for free and pay-in-person flows) and
   **Upgrade the plan** `https://www.wix.com/upgrade/website?metaSiteId=<siteId>` (online payments
   need a premium plan). Both are the owner's steps, not a defect in the site. **Copy the live URL verbatim from the
   `wix release` output — never retype it from memory** (a mistyped subdomain hands the user
   a 404). Before you sign off, run the feedback self-check over the whole session
   (`guides/feedback.md`): anything that cost more turns than it should have, including what you
   recovered from silently, is signal; if anything qualifies, offer to relay it as you deliver the
   links, and send only after an explicit yes.

## Reference mode — a static site, or a server-rendered app in another language

The shipped data layer exists a second time as a **REST layer** over `fetch`, for the stacks that
cannot run `app/`: a static site with no bundler, or a server-rendered app in another language
(Flask, Laravel, Rails). The REST layer deploys for the browser side; the server side ports its
reads. When step 1 resolves to one of these stacks, read `<SKILL_ROOT>/guides/reference-mode.md`
before step 3: it holds the mechanics (the `site/` layout and setup's part in it, what runs in the
browser versus the server, the OAuth allow-list for a self-hosted origin, pre-rendered output) and
how to close such a run. A public site is still better served by managed Astro; say so when you
close.

## Verticals

The shortlist. Match the brief against the first column; when it names a Wix product or a
feature not here, when two rows could fit, or when the request sounds like something this skill
does not ship (meetings, gift cards, loyalty, groups), read
`<SKILL_ROOT>/guides/capabilities.md`: every Wix product, what it covers, which vertical here
ships it and what is not shipped.

Verticals compose: a brief that spans several (a restaurant with a blog, a store with member
accounts) names them all in the setup call (`--vertical restaurants,blog`), so one install covers
them; each vertical's seed runs with its own plan. On a project already built,
`node <SKILL_ROOT>/install/deploy.mjs <vertical…>` from the project root adds one, then one
`npm install`, then its seed. A request that matches no shipped vertical has no shipped
code: say so in one line, then build it from the Wix API reference through `wix-docs` (search,
then the method page), with the same rule as every other call, on the same project and stack,
starting from the closest shipped vertical when one exists (`guides/capabilities.md` says which).
