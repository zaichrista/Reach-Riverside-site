# Management Recipes Index

> **Standard call shape for every curl example across these recipes.** The `<AUTH>` placeholder in example curls is shorthand for the `Authorization` header only; body-bearing calls also need `Content-Type: application/json`.

## What Are Management Recipes?

**Management recipes are for REST API operations** that configure, set up, and manage Wix business entities on your site. These recipes use REST API calls and are designed for:

- **Site setup and configuration** — Initial setup of stores, bookings, payments, and other business apps
- **Entity management** — Creating, updating, and deleting products, services, staff members, pricing plans
- **Administrative operations** — Bulk updates, contact labeling, data migrations
- **Backend integrations** — Server-to-server automations, webhooks, data synchronization

These recipes do NOT cover frontend development or SDK usage for displaying data to users.

## App Installation

### [Install Wix Apps](references/app-installation/install-wix-apps.md)
Installs Wix apps on a site using Apps Installer API. Covers enabling Velo (Wix Code), app installation, and common app definition IDs.

### [List Installed Apps](references/app-installation/list-installed-apps.md)
Lists all apps installed on a site using Apps Installer API. Useful for verifying app installations before making API calls and diagnosing authorization errors.

### [App Management Dashboard Navigation](references/app-installation/app-installation-dashboard-navigation.md)
"Builds direct links to the app-management dashboard pages on manage.wix.com — the App Market and the installed-apps management page. Pairs installed apps with the List Installed Apps read API. Use when the user asks where something is in the Wix dashboard, wants a direct link to a dashboard page, or you need a dashboard URL to include with the result of an API operation."

---

## SEO

### [Manage a Wix Site's SEO Tags](references/seo/manage-seo-tags.md)
Read and update SEO titles and tags at the right level. For "change my site's SEO title", clarify homepage, specific page, or page-type pattern before discovery or writes; site-level tags accept meta tags only, never titles. Discover item IDs and pattern variables, read before every full-replace write, and report resolved tags with their sources.

### [Manage URL Redirects on a Wix Site](references/seo/manage-url-redirects.md)
"Retrieve, create, and delete URL redirects on a Wix site using the public SEO Redirects API. Covers exact and group redirects, language-scoped redirects for multilingual sites, batches of up to 500, and the change flow for a redirect that already exists. This API has no query, search, or update method: List Redirects is the only read-many. Redirects do not chain, so creating one that points at a path another redirect starts from permanently deletes that other redirect; list and check before every write."

### [Generate and Read a Wix Site's Content Plan](references/seo/manage-content-plan.md)
Generate an SEO content plan and read its blog post topics, or troubleshoot an existing content plan flow stuck at KEYWORD_RESEARCH while polling GetContentPlanFlow. Use this recipe for both generation and stalled-flow questions: it explains the intentional pause, the Create Content Plan release request, missing flow IDs, and the exact public API paths and response fields.

### [Manage Google Search Console for a Wix Site](references/seo/manage-google-search-console.md)
"Connect a Wix site to Google Search Console and drive its setup through the public GSC Connection and Site Readiness APIs: check connection and readiness, start the Google authorization, verify ownership, add the property, submit the sitemap, request indexing, read search performance, run URL inspection, recover a stale connection, or disconnect. The site owner authorizes in their own browser via a single-use connect URL."

### [Generate AI SEO Suggestions for a Wix Site](references/seo/manage-seo-suggestions.md)
"Generate AI-written SEO text for a Wix site through the public Tag Suggestions and Page Optimization APIs: title tag and meta description options for a page, alt text for the images of a page, store product, or blog post (one image or up to 20 per call), corrected heading levels for a page's headings, and a whole-page rewrite of title, description, headings, and body text aimed at the page's focus keyword, returned as before/after pairs. Use it when the user wants to improve, optimize, audit, or write the SEO text of a page or the homepage. Suggestions are returned for review; applying one is a separate SEO tags write."

---

## Accessibility

### [Scan a Wix Site for Accessibility Issues](references/accessibility/scan-site-accessibility.md)
Run a Wix accessibility scan for a full site, one page, or every page in any supported page collection, including products, blog posts, booking services, events, and restaurant pages. Poll the asynchronous scan to completion, report failed pages separately, retrieve prioritized findings, and use the returned fix guidance to help the user resolve and verify issues.

---

## Analytics

### [Query Site Analytics](references/analytics/query-site-analytics.md)
Retrieve a Wix site's analytics through the Semantic Model API. Covers listing semantic models, inspecting a model's schema (measures, dimensions, parameters), and querying model data with a required time interval, filters, sorting, paging, and human-readable formatting.

### [Analytics Dashboard Navigation](references/analytics/analytics-dashboard-navigation.md)
"Builds direct links to Wix Analytics dashboard pages on manage.wix.com — highlights, reports, per-domain overviews (traffic, behavior, sales, marketing), and performance insights/benchmarks. Pairs analytics data with its read API so you can answer a question via API and hand back a 'see it in your dashboard' link. Use when the user asks where something is in the Wix dashboard, wants a direct link to a dashboard page, or you need a dashboard URL to include with the result of an API operation."

---

## Blog

### [How to Create Blog Posts](references/blog/how-to-create-blog-posts.md)
Creates and publishes blog posts using Blog Posts API. Covers resolving the required author memberId (including creating an author member when the site has none), Ricos rich content format, image upload via Media Manager, category/tag assignment, and bulk post creation.

### [Blog Dashboard Navigation](references/blog/blog-dashboard-navigation.md)
"Builds direct links to Wix Blog dashboard pages on manage.wix.com — posts list (published and draft tabs), categories, tags, writers, comment moderation, blog analytics, monetization, and settings. Pairs each main Blog entity with its read API so you can fetch an entity and hand back a 'view it in your dashboard' link. Use when the user asks where something is in the Wix dashboard, wants a direct link to a dashboard page, or you need a dashboard URL to include with the result of an API operation."

---

## Bookings

### [Booking Service Policy Setup](references/bookings/booking-service-policy-setup.md)
Sets up booking policies, cancellation rules, and waitlist configuration using the Booking Policies API — query for the (default) bookingPolicy entity, then PATCH it with its revision. Covers cancellationPolicy, reschedulePolicy, booking-notice limits, waitlistPolicy, and participants limits — e.g. "customers can cancel up to 24 hours before".

### [Bookings Staff Setup](references/bookings/bookings-staff-setup.md)
"Creates staff members and configures custom working hours using Staff API + Calendar Events API. Critical two-step process: create staff → assign schedule → create working hours events."

### [Create and Update Booking Services](references/bookings/create-and-update-booking-services.md)
Full CRUD operations for Wix Bookings services using Services API. Covers service types (APPOINTMENT, CLASS, COURSE), pricing configuration, location setup, and schedule management.

### [Create Booking Service from Prompt](references/bookings/create-booking-service-from-prompt.md)
"Create a booking service from a user prompt — e.g. 'create a yoga class for $50', 'set up consultations for $75', 'add a personal training appointment', 'create a 6-week photography workshop', 'create a hidden free test course with 8 online sessions'. Determines the service type (APPOINTMENT, CLASS, or COURSE) and delegates to the type-specific recipe. For COURSE services with session dates/counts, follow the course recipe's separate Calendar bulkCreateEvents step; Services V2 alone does not create bookable course sessions."

### [Create Appointment Service](references/bookings/create-appointment-service.md)
"Create an appointment booking service — e.g. 'set up consultations', 'create a 1-on-1 session', 'add a personal training appointment', 'create a meeting service for $25'. Handles staff assignment (required), session duration, pricing, and 1-on-1 capacity defaults via bulkCreateServices API."

### [Create Class Service](references/bookings/create-class-service.md)
"Create a class booking service — e.g. 'create a yoga class for $50', 'set up a pilates class', 'add a group fitness session', 'create a weekly meditation class'. Handles group capacity, recurring session defaults, and pricing via bulkCreateServices API. Staff assignment is not used for classes."

### [Create Course Service](references/bookings/create-course-service.md)
"Create a course booking service — e.g. 'create a 6-week photography workshop', 'set up a training program', 'add a bootcamp course for $300', 'create a hidden free test course with 8 sessions'. Handles group capacity, full-course pricing, bulkCreateServices, and separate course session events via bulkCreateEvents. Staff assignment is not used for courses."

### [Check Bookings Availability (and Diagnose Issues)](references/bookings/diagnose-availability-issues.md)
"Answers whether an appointment-based Wix Bookings service currently has bookable availability — the primary question — and diagnoses the cause only when there's no availability or the owner asks why. To diagnose, first rules out service-level blockers the availability endpoint can't see (service hidden, online booking off), then runs DiagnoseAvailability for ordered, machine-readable staff/setup reasons, with a manual fallback for booking-policy and capacity causes. Use when someone asks whether a service has availability, or why a service shows no times / customers can't book it."

### [End-to-End Booking Flow](references/bookings/end-to-end-booking-flow.md)
Books and settles appointments, classes and courses with the site owner's credentials — an operator managing bookings, or server-side code booking as the owner. Covers service discovery, availability with Time Slots V2, creating the booking, and settling it by direct confirmation or by taking payment through eCommerce checkout. A visitor booking for themselves needs a visitor token instead; this recipe links that path.

### [External Calendar Integration](references/bookings/external-calendar-integration.md)
OAuth-based integration with Google Calendar, Microsoft Outlook, and Apple Calendar. Covers authentication flows, sync configuration, and bidirectional event management.

### [Multi-Resource Service Creation](references/bookings/multi-resource-service-creation.md)
Creates resource types and individual resources using Resources API. Enables services that require multiple resources (rooms + equipment + staff) with automatic allocation.

### [Bookings Dashboard Navigation](references/bookings/bookings-dashboard-navigation.md)
"Builds direct links to Wix Bookings dashboard pages on manage.wix.com — services list, edit a specific service, calendar, booking list, staff, availability, resources, and settings pages. Pairs each main Bookings entity with its read API so you can fetch an entity and hand back a 'view it in your dashboard' link. Use when the user asks where something is in the Wix dashboard, wants a direct link to a dashboard page, or you need a dashboard URL to include with the result of an API operation."

---

## Calendar

### [Configure Default Business Hours](references/calendar/configure-default-business-hours.md)
Uses Calendar Events API to create WORKING_HOURS events on the business schedule. Covers the critical distinction between Calendar Events API (correct) vs Site Properties API (incorrect) for setting base availability.

> Dashboard links for calendar surfaces (availability, default business hours) are in [Bookings Dashboard Navigation](references/bookings/bookings-dashboard-navigation.md).

---

## CMS

### [CMS Data Items CRUD](references/cms/cms-data-items-crud.md)
"Add, query, update, and delete items in CMS collections, one at a time or in bulk. Also covers counting items, upserting with bulk save, truncating a collection, aggregating data with a pipeline, linking items through single- and multi-reference fields, and reading items with their referenced items expanded."

### [CMS eCommerce Catalog Integration](references/cms/cms-ecommerce-catalog-integration.md)
The recommended way to sell existing CMS collection items (tickets, bookings, memberships) through Wix checkout. Add the CATALOG plugin to convert any CMS collection into purchasable products with cart and payment integration.

### [CMS Schema Management](references/cms/cms-schema-management.md)
Create and modify CMS collection structures. Covers listing collections, creating collections with fields, adding/removing fields (including single- and multi-reference fields that link two collections), and updating collection settings.

### [CMS Draft & Publish Workflow (Draft Items plugin)](references/cms/cms-publishing-flow.md)
"Interact with CMS collections that gate their items behind a draft/publish workflow via the Draft Items plugin. Covers detecting the plugin, locating the paired drafts collection, reading published vs draft items, authoring/editing drafts, and publishing, unpublishing, reverting, and deleting items. Key endpoints: /wix-data/v2/items/publish-draft, /wix-data/v2/items/unpublish, /wix-data/v2/collections/add-draft-items-plugin, and the paired drafts collection referenced by draftItemsPluginOptions.draftsCollectionId."

### [CMS Dashboard Navigation](references/cms/cms-dashboard-navigation.md)
"Builds direct links to the Wix CMS (Content Manager) dashboard pages on manage.wix.com — the collections list and a specific collection's items view. Pairs collections and data items with their read APIs so you can fetch data and hand back a 'view it in your dashboard' link. Use when the user asks where something is in the Wix dashboard, wants a direct link to a dashboard page, or you need a dashboard URL to include with the result of an API operation."

---

## Contacts

### [Bulk Delete Contacts](references/contacts/bulk-delete-contacts.md)
Deletes multiple contacts using filter-based bulk delete. Covers safe deletion patterns, GDPR compliance, soft delete alternatives, and batch processing strategies.

### [Bulk Label and Unlabel Contacts](references/contacts/bulk-label-and-unlabel-contacts.md)
Creates contact label definitions or adds/removes labels from matching contacts. Use Find or Create Label for label creation alone; use bulk labeling only when the user requests contact assignments.

### [Create a Contact](references/contacts/create-a-contact.md)
Creates a contact with the Contacts API. Covers the minimum identifying fields, the single-object shape of `email` and `phone`, and adding a physical address with the ISO 3166-2 subdivision format required for state, region, and province codes.

### [Update a Contact](references/contacts/update-a-contact.md)
Updates an existing contact's email, phone, name, or address with the Contacts API. Covers locating the contact when the user identifies it by name, passing its current revision, and the ISO 3166-2 subdivision format required for state, region and province codes.

### [Contacts Dashboard Navigation](references/contacts/contacts-dashboard-navigation.md)
"Builds direct links to Wix Contacts (CRM) dashboard pages on manage.wix.com — the contacts list, a specific contact's view page, contact import, and the segments page. Pairs each main contacts entity with its read API so you can fetch an entity and hand back a 'view it in your dashboard' link. Use when the user asks where something is in the Wix dashboard, wants a direct link to a dashboard page, or you need a dashboard URL to include with the result of an API operation."

---

## Dashboard Navigation

**Dashboard URLs are recipe data, not general knowledge.** A `manage.wix.com` route is an app-registered slug that appears in no API reference and cannot be derived from the entity's name or its API path (Forms pages live under `wix-forms`, not `contacts/forms`; Stores products under `wix-stores/products`). So for **every** request for a dashboard link — even one that needs no API call, and even when a route feels obvious — open the solution's dashboard-navigation recipe below and copy the route from its table. Answering from memory is the one failure mode these recipes exist to prevent.

### [Dashboard Navigation](references/dashboard-navigation/dashboard-navigation.md)
**Index** — for any "where do I manage X in the dashboard" / "give me a dashboard link" request: the shared URL structure for all dashboard pages (`https://manage.wix.com/dashboard/{metaSiteId}/{route}`, app-ID fallback, legacy redirects, entity deep links), routing to the per-business-solution recipes (e.g. [Bookings](references/bookings/bookings-dashboard-navigation.md), [Stores](references/stores/stores-dashboard-navigation.md)) which live in their solution's section below.

---

## Domains

### [Domain Search, Purchase and Connect](references/domains/domain-search-purchase-and-connect.md)
Buy a domain through Wix or connect one the user already owns — intent, availability, suggestions, site resolution, registration, privacy, cart and checkout, plus the connect path including ownership lookup and binding a domain to a site.

### [Domains Dashboard Navigation](references/domains/domains-dashboard-navigation.md)
"Builds direct links to the domain-management pages on manage.wix.com — the site-level domain settings page and the account-level My Domains page. Pairs domain search/purchase with its read APIs. Use when the user asks where something is in the Wix dashboard, wants a direct link to a dashboard page, or you need a dashboard URL to include with the result of an API operation."

## eCommerce

**Routing — pick the right entry point:**
- **Any sales/business improvement request** (boost sales, promotions, help my business, holiday deals, improve revenue, discounts, shipping, coupons, clearance, gift cards) → use [Recommend: eCommerce Strategy](references/ecommerce/recommend-ecommerce-strategy.md). This is the **default entry point** — it analyzes ALL domains (discounts, shipping, gift cards) and generates cross-domain recommendations. Do NOT ask clarifying questions.
- **Traffic acquisition is NOT an eCommerce-strategy request** ("grow my traffic", SEO, ads, social, content) → do NOT use Recommend: eCommerce Strategy; it only converts visitors a store already has. Route these to marketing.
- **Pricing & promotions** (coupons, discount rules, ribbons, sales) → use the [Pricing & Promotions](references/ecommerce/ecom-pricing.md) dispatcher.
- **Shipping setup** (rates, regions, pickup, free shipping, fix coverage) → use the [Shipping](references/ecommerce/ecom-shipping.md) dispatcher.
- **Gift cards** ("should I sell gift cards", "add a gift card", "what amounts should my gift card have") → these are recommendations, so they go through [Recommend: eCommerce Strategy](references/ecommerce/recommend-ecommerce-strategy.md), which activates its GIFT_CARDS domain and loads the gift-cards goal itself. Issuing/redeeming an individual gift card is the Gift Cards API, not a recommendation.

### [eCommerce: Load Context](references/ecommerce/ecom-load-context.md)
**L1 loader** — loads general site data (siteId, country, currency, industry, catalog analytics) needed by every eCommerce category. Each category dispatcher loads this before tag-matching; runs once per session.

### [Recommend: eCommerce Strategy](references/ecommerce/recommend-ecommerce-strategy.md)
**Entry point for all eCommerce recommendation requests.** Unified skill that analyzes site data across ALL domains (discounts + shipping + gift cards), generates up to 5 cross-domain recommendations, and persists them to the tracking database. Covers discount strategies (seasonal, upsell, stock mover, bundling), shipping optimization (coverage gaps, free shipping, rate strategy, carrier backup), AND selling gift cards (denominations sized from the site's own AOV and catalog prices). Use this for business improvement requests about earning more from existing visitors. **Traffic acquisition (SEO, ads, social, content) is out of scope** — route "grow my traffic" to marketing.

### [Pricing & Promotions](references/ecommerce/ecom-pricing.md)
Routes discounts, coupons, sales and bundles to promotion recipes, and visual product ribbons to the Catalog Ribbons API. Load this dispatcher for mixed pricing/refund/payment/product-price/shipping requests to choose the appropriate APIs.

### [Shipping](references/ecommerce/ecom-shipping.md)
**Dispatcher** — routes shipping-setup requests (rates, regions, pickup, free shipping, fix coverage, optimize rates) to the right leaf recipe. The Shipping Options + Delivery Profiles APIs have no public docs page; `ecom-shipping-api.md` is the authoritative inline reference.

---

## Events

### [Create an Event with the Wix Events API](references/events/create-wix-event.md)
"Creates an event with the Wix Events V3 API — the required request body, ISO-8601 date and time settings, venue/online/TBD location, RSVP vs ticketed registration, guest capacity, short vs rich-text descriptions, ticket tiers and pricing, and recurring series. Covers the exact field shapes and the API's misleading validation messages. Use when the user wants to create an event, set its date, location, description, guest limit or ticket prices, or set up a repeating event."

### [Manage Wix Events — Publishing, Cancelling, Cloning and Counting](references/events/manage-wix-events.md)
"Operates on events that already exist with the Wix Events V3 API — finding an event by title, publishing a draft, cancelling, deleting (one or by filter), cloning, updating an event's date or details, and counting events. Use when the user wants to find, publish or cancel an event, duplicate one, move an event's date, delete events in bulk, or count their events. Creating an event, its tickets or a recurring series is a separate recipe."

---

## Forms

### [Create Form](references/forms/create-form.md)
"Creates a visitor-fillable Wix form with Form Schemas v4 — a contact or enquiry form, a signup or waitlist, an application, a survey, a quote request, and forms whose submissions create a contact. Ships a complete create request, plus the field table for every kind Wix supports — dropdown, choice, file upload, rating, address, payment, and the silent breakers that produce an empty or invisible form. Changing a form that already exists is Update Form."

### [Update Form](references/forms/update-form.md)
"Changes a Wix form that already exists, with Form Schemas v4 `PATCH` — add a field to my form, add a dropdown, make a field required or optional, rename a label, reorder or retire a question. Covers reading the form back for its `revision` (and the required `namespace` query parameter), the whole-form body that a `PATCH` needs, the wholesale `formFields` replace that silently soft-deletes anything you omit, changing a field's component type in place, retiring a field that already has submissions, and the read-back that proves what was stored. Use whenever the form exists and the request changes what it collects; use Create Form when there is no form yet."

### [Forms Dashboard Navigation](references/forms/forms-dashboard-navigation.md)
"Builds direct links to Wix Forms dashboard pages on manage.wix.com. The paths are not guessable and appear in no API reference, so take them from here: under `https://manage.wix.com/dashboard/{metaSiteId}/`, the forms list is `wix-forms`, a form's builder is `wix-forms/form/{formId}`, and that form's submissions are `wix-forms/form/{formId}/submissions` — there is no site-wide submissions page, and nothing lives under `contacts/forms`, `forms`, `form-builder` or `wix-forms-and-payments` (the legacy app). Also standalone forms, and each Forms entity paired with its read API so you can fetch one and hand back a 'view it in your dashboard' link."

---

## Get Paid

### [Create Payment Links](references/get-paid/create-payment-links.md)
Creates payment links for collecting payments without a checkout flow. Covers store products (catalog items), custom line items, variants, due dates, and sending links via email.

### [How to Setup Wix Payments](references/get-paid/how-to-setup-wix-payments.md)
Configures Wix Payments as the payment provider. Covers eligibility checking, business verification, bank account setup, and payment method configuration (cards, PayPal, Apple Pay).

### [Payment Links for Bookings](references/get-paid/payment-links-for-bookings.md)
Creates payment links for unpaid bookings using Payment Links API. Links booking IDs to payment requests with proper redirect handling.

### [Get Paid Dashboard Navigation](references/get-paid/get-paid-dashboard-navigation.md)
"Builds direct links to Wix payments and invoicing dashboard pages on manage.wix.com — payment links, invoices (list, create, settings), recurring invoices, and the accept-payments settings page. Pairs each main get-paid entity with its read API so you can fetch an entity and hand back a 'view it in your dashboard' link. Use when the user asks where something is in the Wix dashboard, wants a direct link to a dashboard page, or you need a dashboard URL to include with the result of an API operation."

## Google Ads

**Routing — Google paid-advertising campaigns for a site (Smart & Performance Max).** All flows require a Google Ads account, created once via the setup recipe. Budgets are in micros (1,000,000 = 1 currency unit). REST base: `https://www.wixapis.com/_serverless/pa-google/v1`.
- **First-time setup / "connect Google Ads" / `ACCOUNT_NOT_FOUND`** → [Install and Create an Account](references/google-ads/install-and-create-account.md) (do this before anything else).

Covers checking whether an account already exists, choosing a currency, optionally attaching a promotional incentive (credit offer), linking a Google Merchant Center account, and deleting an account. Use when the user wants to 'set up Google Ads', 'connect Google Ads', 'start advertising on Google', 'create a Google Ads account', or hits an ACCOUNT_NOT_FOUND / app-not-installed error before creating a campaign. Google Ads REST API, base https://www.wixapis.com/_serverless/pa-google/v1."

### [Get AI Campaign Suggestions for Google Ads](references/google-ads/get-campaign-suggestions.md)
"Reference for the Google Ads Suggestions API on a Wix site: AI/Google-generated inputs that help build effective campaigns — keyword themes (from a URL or autocomplete), geo-target options, low/recommended/high daily-budget tiers with estimated clicks, PMAX budget recommendations, text assets (headlines/descriptions), AI image assets (auto-uploaded to Wix Media), search themes, promotional incentive offers, and complete AI-generated campaign configurations from a campaign brief. Use when the user asks 'suggest keywords for my ads', 'what budget should I use', 'where should I target', 'generate ad copy/headlines', 'generate ad images', 'suggest a whole campaign', or when a create-campaign flow needs suggested values.

Covers generating AI text and image assets, generating search themes, getting a Google budget recommendation, assembling the asset group with the required minimum assets, choosing PERFORMANCE_MAX vs PERFORMANCE_MAX_LEADS (leads: phone/form goals, negative keywords, 28-day learning) vs retail/Shopping (Merchant Center feed), creating in PAUSED, and launching. Use for 'create a Performance Max campaign', 'PMAX', 'run ads across all of Google', 'lead-gen Google campaign', or 'Google Shopping ads'. Requires an existing Google Ads account.

## Google Business Profile

**Routing — how a business appears on Google Search and Maps.** A Google connection is the prerequisite for all Google-backed location work: check it first, and route "connect / reconnect / disconnect Google" to the connection recipe.

### [Connect a Wix Site to Google Business Profile](references/google-business-profile/connect-google-business-profile.md)
Connect the authenticated Wix site to a Google Business Profile account, check whether an existing connection is still usable, recover a connection whose stored credentials are gone, switch to a different Google account, or disconnect. The site owner authorizes in their own browser through a single-use connect URL; the agent never completes the Google authorization itself. Warns before any reconnect that permanently removes the site's imported locations.

### [Manage Google Business Profile Locations for a Wix Site](references/google-business-profile/manage-google-business-profile-locations.md)
Import Google Business Profile locations into the authenticated Wix site, list and query them with or without live Google data, update Wix-side and Google-side details through the correct method for each, create a new Google listing, check whether a profile is actually live on Google, and remove a location from Wix or delete its Google listing. Checks the site's Google connection first and reports a missing one as a setup step, warns before destructive or Google-visible writes, and respects Google's shared rate budget.

## Marketing

### [Create and Publish a Social Media Post (with AI generation)](references/marketing/create-and-publish-social-post.md)
"End-to-end flow to create a social media post, optionally generating it with AI, and publish or schedule it to a site's connected channel (Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, X/Twitter, TikTok, Pinterest, YouTube, Google Business Profile) using the Wix Publisher API. Can generate a full per-channel post from a free-text idea or from the site's own assets (products, blog posts, events, bookings, coupons, categories), generate caption/title suggestions, and edit an existing image with AI. Settles the post content with you first, then confirms the channel is connected, checks premium quota, creates a draft, and publishes now or schedules it. Use for 'create a post', 'generate a post from my product/idea', 'write a caption', 'caption ideas/suggestions', 'edit a post image with AI', 'post to Instagram/Facebook/TikTok', 'connect my Instagram/Pinterest/LinkedIn', or 'schedule a post'."

### [Generate a Marketing Plan and Schedule Its Posts](references/marketing/generate-and-publish-marketing-plan.md)
"End-to-end flow to generate an AI-powered social media marketing plan for a site and schedule its generated posts for publishing, using the Wix Marketing Plan API. Recommends configuring marketing settings (goal, tone, cadence, content pillars) before the first generation, generates the plan asynchronously, polls until it's ready, then schedules the DRAFT posts. Includes generating posts for additional activities. Use for 'generate a marketing plan', 'create a social media plan/calendar', or 'schedule my plan's posts' requests."

### [Marketing Dashboard Navigation](references/marketing/marketing-dashboard-navigation.md)
"Builds direct links to Wix marketing dashboard pages on manage.wix.com — the social posts hub (drafts, scheduled and published posts across connected channels), post design templates, saved designs, and the email marketing pages (campaigns list, campaign templates, campaign analytics). Pairs each main marketing entity (social post item, connected social account, marketing-plan post, email campaign) with its read API so you can fetch an entity and hand back a 'view it in your dashboard' link. Use when the user asks where something is in the Wix dashboard, wants a direct link to a dashboard page, or you need a dashboard URL to include with the result of an API operation."

### [Generate an Image with AI](references/media/generate-image-with-ai.md)
Generates an image from a text prompt with the Wix AI APIs (Runware). Returns a short-lived URL that must be imported to be kept — importing is Upload Media to Wix's job, and this recipe hands off to it. Covers choosing a model and its cost/latency/content-filter trade-off, the accepted output sizes, per-model batching limits, the AI credit each call spends, and why a content refusal arrives as a success response with no image.

## Rich Content

> **Routing rule (READ FIRST).** For every request to hand-author, output, or return Ricos / `richContent` JSON (`nodes` tree) for Blog, Stores, Events, or CMS, use the available full-documentation reading capability to retrieve and read the canonical [Author Ricos Rich Content](references/rich-content/author-ricos-rich-content.md) recipe before using API schema search, convert/validate APIs, or memory. This also applies when the user asks for JSON only.

### [Ricos Converter Service](references/rich-content/ricos-converter-service.md)

## Sites

### [Create Site from Template](references/sites/create-site-from-template.md)
Creates new Wix sites from templates using account-level APIs. Covers template search, site creation, and publishing. Not for headless sites.

### [Create Headless Site](references/sites/create-headless-site.md)
Creates a Wix Headless site (headless business) with one account-level API call — site, Wix Business Solution apps, and a configured OAuth client.

### [Manage OAuth Apps](references/sites/manage-oauth-apps.md)
Create, read, update, and query OAuth apps for a Wix headless site. Each OAuth app's id is the client_id a frontend uses to mint anonymous visitor tokens and call Wix APIs.

### [Query Sites](references/sites/query-sites.md)
List, count, and find the sites in a Wix account. Covers the namespace filter for headless sites, counting before enumerating, cursor pagination, and resolving a site by name.

### [Read Account or Site Context](references/sites/read-site-context.md)
Probe a Wix site or account for full context in one call — installed apps by display name, locale, currency, timezone, and status. Account token + siteId targets one site; account token alone returns up to 10; site-scoped token alone returns the site it is scoped to.

### [Site Import](references/sites/site-import.md)
Drive the Wix Site Import agent to migrate an existing store or site from another platform (Shopify, WooCommerce, Magento, or any URL) into Wix — as a brand-new site or into the user's existing one — or to import from CSV/TSV export files with no source site. Use this skill whenever the user wants to import, migrate, or clone a store/site into Wix, mentions moving off Shopify/WooCommerce/Magento, or gives a source store URL and asks to bring it into Wix. Covers starting the import, polling progress, answering the agent's mid-import questions, handling deploy/failure/auth-expiry states, and sending post-deploy follow-up changes.

### [Sites Dashboard Navigation](references/sites/sites-dashboard-navigation.md)
"Builds direct links to the account-level sites pages on manage.wix.com — the My Sites list (all sites in the account) and each site's own dashboard. Pairs the site list with the Query Sites read API. Use when the user asks where something is in the Wix dashboard, wants a direct link to a dashboard page, or you need a dashboard URL to include with the result of an API operation."

### [Upload a Website or HTML Files](references/sites/upload-static-site.md)
Publish a user's ready-made website — an index.html, a static build, or a zip exported from an AI builder or any other tool — as a new live Wix site. Covers both ways to get there — handing the user the Wix Headless drop page, and calling the Wix Headless instant-site REST API yourself when you can reach the files and make outbound HTTPS requests. When you also hold the user's identity, covers putting the published site straight into their Wix account and reading back its final live URL. Use whenever the user wants to upload, publish, deploy, or host their own HTML/CSS/JS as a NEW site, including files generated for them earlier in the conversation, or to update a site already published this way (iterate on the same site instead of creating another). Not for migrating a live store/site from another platform by URL or from CSV exports (use Site Import), not for adding HTML or custom code into an existing Wix site, and not for uploading images or documents to a site's media files.

### [Change Store Currency](references/stores/change-store-currency.md)
Changes the store's payment currency through Site Properties and explains delayed currency updates in catalog responses.

### [Create Product (Catalog V3)](references/stores/create-product-catalog-v3.md)
Mandatory first recipe for every Wix Stores Catalog V3 create-product request. Before any mutation, require an explicit name and price for every product; an absent price is never 0. If no product is identified, offer both image-upload and text-description paths and stop. If name or price is missing, ask or offer a suggestion and stop. When both are present, create from the supplied details without requiring optional enrichment. Covers single/bulk creation, inventory, physical/digital products, images, options, variants, SKUs, and validation.

### [Find Products (Query and Search, Catalog V3)](references/stores/find-products-query-and-search-catalog-v3.md)

### [Stores Dashboard Navigation](references/stores/stores-dashboard-navigation.md)
"Builds direct links to Wix Stores and eCommerce dashboard pages on manage.wix.com — products list, edit a specific product, categories, inventory, orders list, a specific order, abandoned checkouts, gift cards, shipping and tax settings. Pairs each main Stores/eCommerce entity with its read API so you can fetch an entity and hand back a 'view it in your dashboard' link. Use when the user asks where something is in the Wix dashboard, wants a direct link to a dashboard page, or you need a dashboard URL to include with the result of an API operation."
