description: Read and update SEO titles and tags at the right level. For "change my site's SEO title", clarify homepage, specific page, or page-type pattern before discovery or writes; site-level tags accept meta tags only, never titles. Discover item IDs and pattern variables, read before every full-replace write, and report resolved tags with their sources.

# Manage a Wix Site's SEO Tags

Use the public **SEO APIs** to read and write the titles, descriptions, social
share tags, canonical links, structured data, and indexing directives of the
authenticated Wix site. The API selects the site from the caller's
authorization context; never ask for or send a site ID.

Writing tags requires the **Manage SEO Settings** permission. Reading tags or
listing pattern variables does not prove that the caller can write.

## The one rule that must never be skipped

**Every write replaces the target's tags in full, so a Get always immediately
precedes a Set.** There is no partial update: sending only the tag the user
asked about deletes every other tag that item, pattern, or site had. So before
any Set, call the matching Get for that exact target, merge the requested change
into the tags it returns, and send the complete set back.

Never write from the user's request alone, and never skip the Get because the
change looks small, because a list call already returned something, or because
the target looks empty. The Set response returns the updated tags and
`resolvedTags`, so report the outcome from that response instead of issuing
another read.

## Choose the level

Wix combines tags from several sources, where a more specific source wins.
Match the user's request to the level that owns the change:

| User intent | Level | API |
|---|---|---|
| "Change my site's default social image", site verification tags, site-wide indexing | Site | **Site SEO Tags** |
| "All my product/blog/event pages should be titled like X" — a convention for every item of a page type | Pattern | **SEO Patterns** |
| "Change the title of this page/product/post" — one specific item | Item | **Item SEO Tags** |

**Site SEO Tags accepts meta tags only** (including site-level social image
and robots settings). Never send `title`, `link`, or `script` tags to
`PATCH /site-seo-tags`. Use Item SEO Tags for a specific page's title, or
SEO Patterns for a page-type title convention. See the
[Site SEO Tags object](https://dev.wix.com/docs/api-reference/business-management/seo/site-seo-tags-v1/site-seo-tags-object).

If the user says "change my site's SEO title" without identifying a page or
page type, ask whether they mean the homepage, another specific page, or a
page-type title convention. Ask immediately after reading this recipe; do not make discovery or schema
queries until scope is clear. For an explicit
homepage request, discover its actual ID; never assume an ID such as `home`.
Use Item SEO Tags with `STATIC_PAGE`, read its current tags, and merge the title
into the complete set. Follow the static-page publication rules below.
Do not substitute `og:title` for the requested SEO title.

Work at the level that matches the change. Writing the same title onto many
items is the same outcome as one pattern and much harder to undo. If the user's
words fit more than one level, ask one short question before writing. An
explicit request to change a specific tag at a clear level is already
confirmation to make that write.

All three APIs live under the **SEO** category of the Wix REST API reference.
The request shapes are in the section below — construct requests from them. The
reference article URLs follow this pattern (for edge cases not covered here):

`https://dev.wix.com/docs/api-reference/business-management/seo/{api}/` + method slug

| Level | API slug | Methods (slug) |
|---|---|---|
| Site | `site-seo-tags-v1` | Get Site SEO Tags (`get-site-seo-tags`), Set Site SEO Tags (`set-site-seo-tags`) |
| Pattern | `seo-pattern-v1` | Get SEO Pattern (`get-seo-pattern`), List SEO Patterns (`list-seo-patterns`), List SEO Pattern Variables (`list-seo-pattern-variables`), Create SEO Pattern (`create-seo-pattern`), Set SEO Pattern (`set-seo-pattern`), Reset SEO Pattern To Default (`reset-seo-pattern-to-default`) |
| Item | `item-seo-tags-v1` | Get Item SEO Tags (`get-item-seo-tags`), List Item SEO Tags (`list-item-seo-tags`), Set Item SEO Tags (`set-item-seo-tags`), Bulk Set Item SEO Tags (`bulk-set-item-seo-tags`), Reset Item SEO Tags To Default (`reset-item-seo-tags-to-default`) |

## REST request and response shapes

Use these shapes directly — do not go looking for them in the docs first.

Build requests from the shapes below. Do not search the API schemas or read
the reference article to construct them.

### Set Item SEO Tags — `PATCH /item-seo-tags/{itemType}/{itemId}`

```json
{
  "itemSeoTags": {
    "tags": [
      { "type": "title", "children": "Page title here" },
      { "type": "meta", "props": { "name": "description", "content": "Description here" } }
    ]
  },
  "fieldMask": "tags"
}
```

### Get Item SEO Tags — `GET /item-seo-tags/{itemType}/{itemId}`

No request body. Returns `itemSeoTags` with `tags`, `resolvedTags`,
`hasOverride`, `publishStatus`, and `hostPageId`.

### List Item SEO Tags — `GET /item-seo-tags/{itemType}?paging.limit=100`

No request body. Returns `itemSeoTags[]` and `pagingMetadata` with cursors.
`itemSeoTagsList` is not a response field. Each array entry is an Item SEO Tags
object directly, not a wrapper: read `entry.itemId`, `entry.tags`, and
`entry.resolvedTags`, not `entry.itemSeoTags`. Use `itemId` as the path ID;
`id` is a composite identifier and `hostPageId` is not the item identifier.

For static-page discovery, call this with `STATIC_PAGE`. Example response:

```json
{
  "itemSeoTags": [
    {
      "itemType": "STATIC_PAGE",
      "itemId": "<page-id>",
      "tags": [],
      "resolvedTags": [
        { "tag": { "type": "title", "children": "Home | Studio Shop" },
          "source": "TAG_SOURCE_DEFAULT_PATTERN" }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "pagingMetadata": { "hasNext": false }
}
```

Inspect the returned page identities and resolved tags to identify the requested
page, then Get that exact `itemId` before writing. If the response does not
unambiguously identify it, ask the user to identify the page. Do not interpret
a missing response field as an empty page list, assume the first entry is the
homepage, or create/update a pattern as a fallback for a missing page. A
single-page request never authorizes changing all pages of its type.
See [List Item SEO Tags](https://dev.wix.com/docs/api-reference/business-management/seo/item-seo-tags-v1/list-item-seo-tags).

### Set Site SEO Tags — `PATCH /site-seo-tags`

```json
{
  "siteSeoTags": {
    "tags": [
      { "type": "meta", "props": { "name": "google-site-verification", "content": "token" } }
    ]
  },
  "fieldMask": "tags"
}
```

### Set SEO Pattern — `PATCH /seo-patterns/{pageType}`

```json
{
  "seoPattern": {
    "pattern": {
      "tags": [
        { "type": "title", "children": "{{item.name}} | {{site.name}}" }
      ]
    }
  },
  "fieldMask": "pattern"
}
```

### Common rules across all shapes

A tag is `{type, props, children}`: `title` and `script` carry their text in
`children`; `meta` and `link` carry theirs in `props` (`name`/`content` for a
meta tag, `rel`/`href` for a link).

`fieldMask` over REST is a comma-separated **string** (`"fieldMask": "tags"`);
the SDK takes an **array** (`fieldMask: ["tags"]`). Sending an array to REST
returns `INVALID_FIELD_MASK`. `publish` is a boolean.

`resolvedTags` in any Get or Set response is an array of
`{tag, source, inheritedTag}`. `source` is one of `TAG_SOURCE_SITE`,
`TAG_SOURCE_DEFAULT_PATTERN`, `TAG_SOURCE_USER_PATTERN`, `TAG_SOURCE_HOST_PAGE`,
`TAG_SOURCE_ITEM`, or `TAG_SOURCE_UNSPECIFIED`. `inheritedTag` appears only when
this source replaced a value a lower source had set.

All paths are relative to `https://www.wixapis.com/promote/seo/v1`.

## Discover, never invent

- An item is addressed by an **item type and item ID together**, not by URL.
  Common item types: `STATIC_PAGE`, `STORES_PRODUCT`, `STORES_CATEGORY`,
  `BLOG_POST`, `BLOG_CATEGORY`, `BOOKINGS_SERVICE`, `EVENTS_PAGE`,
  `PORTFOLIO_PROJECTS`, `PORTFOLIO_COLLECTIONS`, `RESTAURANTS_MENU_PAGE`.
- To find an item's ID when the user refers to it by name (e.g. a product
  name), use Search Products v3: `POST /stores/v3/products/search`
  to get the product ID, then use that ID as the `itemId` with item type
  `STORES_PRODUCT`. Do not call List Item SEO Tags and scan through all items
  to match by name — use the vertical API.
- Never fabricate an item ID. If you cannot find the item through its vertical
  API or List Item SEO Tags, ask the user.
- Item types exist on a site only when the business solution providing them is
  installed. The authoritative list of supported item types is in the
  `UNSUPPORTED_ITEM_TYPE` error message; do not hardcode one beyond the common
  values listed above.
- Before writing a pattern, call **List SEO Pattern Variables** for the page
  type and build the pattern only from returned variables. Never invent a
  variable name.
- Dynamic Wix Data pages are addressed by `pageId`; addressing a pattern by
  collection name is not supported.

## The write sequence

Exactly three calls, in this order, with no extra probing:

1. **Get** the current tags or pattern for the target. Required — see the rule
   above.
2. **Set** the complete merged set, naming only the changed fields in the field
   mask.
3. Report from the **Set response**, which returns the updated tags and
   `resolvedTags`. Do not issue a verification read: the write response is the
   confirmation. Read again only to check a static page's published revision
   after `publish: true`, or when the user asks about a target you have not read
   in this session.

To remove an item's own tags so it inherits again, call **Reset Item SEO Tags To
Default** (or **Reset SEO Pattern To Default**) — never set an empty list to
mean "reset".

## Worked example: set a product's SEO title and description

The user asks: *"Set the SEO title of my product 'Handmade Mug' to 'Handmade
Ceramic Mug | Studio Shop' and its description to 'A stoneware mug.'"*

**Step 1 — find the product ID.** Search Products v3 by name:

```
POST https://www.wixapis.com/stores/v3/products/search
{ "search": { "search": { "expression": "Handmade Mug" } } }
```

```json
{ "products": [{ "id": "a1b2c3d4-...", "name": "Handmade Mug", ... }] }
```

Take `products[0].id`. The item type is `STORES_PRODUCT`. Do not use Query
Products with a `name` filter — `name` is not filterable and returns 400.

**Step 2 — read the current tags.**

```
GET https://www.wixapis.com/promote/seo/v1/item-seo-tags/STORES_PRODUCT/{productId}
```

```json
{
  "itemSeoTags": {
    "tags": [],
    "hasOverride": false,
    "resolvedTags": [
      { "tag": { "type": "title", "children": "Handmade Mug | My Site" },
        "source": "TAG_SOURCE_DEFAULT_PATTERN" }
    ]
  }
}
```

`tags` is empty because the item has no overrides yet. `resolvedTags` shows
what the page currently renders with and where each tag comes from.

**Step 3 — merge and write.** Take the full `tags` array from step 2, replace
or add the title and description, and send the complete set back:

```json
PATCH /item-seo-tags/STORES_PRODUCT/{productId}
{
  "itemSeoTags": {
    "tags": [
      { "type": "title", "children": "Handmade Ceramic Mug | Studio Shop" },
      { "type": "meta", "props": { "name": "description", "content": "A stoneware mug." } }
    ]
  },
  "fieldMask": "tags"
}
```

**Step 4 — report from the response.** The Set response returns the updated
`tags` and `resolvedTags`. Report each resolved tag with its source. Do not
issue another Get — the write response is the confirmation.

## Common agent mistakes — do not make these

- **Searching the API schemas or reading the reference article before the first
  call.** The request shapes are in this recipe. If you get a 400, compare your
  request against the shapes in this recipe — do not go to the docs.
- **Searching for the SEO endpoints through API spec tools.** The shapes are
  above; searching wastes a turn.
- **Sending `fieldMask` as an array over REST.** Over REST it is a
  comma-separated string: `"fieldMask": "tags"`. The SDK's `["tags"]` array
  returns `INVALID_FIELD_MASK`.
- **Guessing the item type.** Use the values in the Discover section. A store
  product is `STORES_PRODUCT`, not `StoresProduct`, `product`, or `Product`.

- **Issuing a verification Get after a successful Set.** The Set response
  already carries `resolvedTags`. A second read is redundant.
- **Using Products v1 or filtering by `name` on Query Products.** Both return
  400. Use Search Products v3: `POST /stores/v3/products/search` with
  `{"search":{"search":{"expression":"..."}}}`.
- **Calling List Item SEO Tags expecting product names.** List returns IDs
  and tags, not names. Use Search Products to find the ID by name first.
- **Retrying a 400 with a different request shape without checking why.** A 400
  can mean the target level is wrong, not just the shape. Read the validation
  message and check the level rules first. Compare against the shapes in this
  recipe, fix the mismatch, send once. Three retries with guessed shapes is three wasted calls.

Tags can currently be written only for the site's primary language: leave
`language` unset on every write. There is no revision checking — the last write
wins and dashboard edits write to the same data, so read immediately before
writing.

**Static pages** keep a draft and a published revision: a write updates the
draft unless `publish` is `true`, and `publish: true` updates only the
published revision. Say clearly which revision the change reached. Item types
that are always live, such as store products, need no publish step.

## Bulk writes

To set tags on many items, call **Bulk Set Item SEO Tags** once, not Set in a
loop. Expected per-item failures (invalid tags, item not found) fail only that
entry and are reported on that entry's `itemMetadata.error`; map results back
to the request with `originalIndex` and retry only the failed entries. Report
partial failures truthfully — never present a partially failed bulk write as a
success.

## Present results

- When reporting what a page will render with, use the `resolvedTags` already
  returned by the last Get or Set — not a fresh call — and name the source of
  each tag (site, default pattern, user pattern, host page, or the item
  itself). Naming the source of each reported tag is required, not optional.
  `hasOverride: false` does not mean built-in defaults — the item may inherit
  from a customized pattern or the site.
- `resolvedTags` excludes tags added by site code or apps at render time, so
  present it as what Wix manages, not a literal copy of the rendered page head.


## Recovery rules

- **Permission denied:** stop after the first `403` or `PERMISSION_DENIED`. Do
  not retry with another item, level, request shape, or site. Explain that the
  current Wix identity lacks **Manage SEO Settings** and must be reconnected or
  authorized. Never imply that a successful read means the write ran.
- **`UNSUPPORTED_ITEM_TYPE`:** the error message lists the item types the API
  supports; use it to redirect the request rather than retrying blindly.
- **`ITEM_NOT_FOUND`:** re-discover the item ID; do not guess a new one.
- **Unsupported site-level tag / `FIELD_NOT_ALLOWED`:** a rejected `title`,
  `link`, or `script` is a wrong-level error, not a nesting or field-mask error.
  Do not retry it at site level or silently drop the requested tag. Clarify the
  target if needed, then use the appropriate item or pattern API. Get that
  target's current tags before merging and writing; never reuse the site's
  tags as the new target's complete set. A rejected write saved no changes.
- **Invalid tags:** tags are validated before anything is saved, so nothing
  changed; fix the tag and resend the same complete set.
- **`400` on a request you built from this recipe:** compare the request you
  sent against the shapes in this recipe's "REST request and response shapes"
  section and the wrong-level recovery rule above. Fix the mismatch — a wrong
  nesting level, a missing wrapper key, or `fieldMask` sent as an array instead of a string — and send again. Never
  resend the same shape, and never walk through variations hoping one is
  accepted.
- **Setting tags for `EVENTS_PAGE` items:** not supported yet, although reading
  them is; say so instead of retrying.

This recipe is self-contained for the common flows: request shapes, field
masks, tag structure, `resolvedTags` format, discovery, and error handling are
all above. Do not read the method's reference article and do not search the
API schemas — build every request from this recipe alone.
