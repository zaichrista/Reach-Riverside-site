# Flow: Upsell Boost Campaign

> **Before executing this skill**, read [Create Discount Rule](https://dev.wix.com/docs/api-reference/business-solutions/e-commerce/skills/pricing-create-discount-rule) with `ReadFullDocsArticle` — it contains the discount-rule mechanics **and** the pre-create guardrails (conflict/stacking, margin floor, %-sanity).

Creates a discount that incentivizes customers to spend more per order by setting a minimum subtotal threshold above the store's current AOV. The discount percentage is scaled to the store's average profit margin, and the scope targets high-margin categories or products.

## Prerequisites

- Products exist in the catalog with price data (`siteData.hasCatalog === true`, checked at context load)
- AOV data available from site metrics (`siteData.aov`, loaded by eCommerce Load Context)

## Required APIs

- [Create Discount Rule](https://dev.wix.com/docs/api-reference/business-solutions/e-commerce/extensions/discounts/discount-rules/create-discount-rule)
- [Query Discount Rules](https://dev.wix.com/docs/api-reference/business-solutions/e-commerce/extensions/discounts/discount-rules/query-discount-rules)

## Step 1: Use pre-loaded catalog data

Catalog analytics and product data are already in conversation context — do NOT re-fetch:

- `siteData.catalogAnalytics` — category groups with `count()`, `quantiles([0.5,0.75,0.9], price)`, `avg(profitMargin)`. Loaded by the eCommerce Load Context.
- `siteData.productCatalogData` — per-product list sorted `price DESC, ordersCount DESC` for UPSELL_BOOST goal. Loaded by the run-a-sale orchestrator Step 5.
- `siteData.aov` — site-level AOV (revenue / ordersCount). Loaded by eCommerce Load Context.

Extract from context:
- `effective_aov` — use `siteData.aov`; run AOV sanity check: if AOV < price_p25, override with price_p50 as effective AOV
- `avg_profit_margin` — from the "All Products" group in `siteData.catalogAnalytics`
- `price_p50`, `price_p75`, `price_p90` — from quantiles in `siteData.catalogAnalytics`
- Top products by price and order volume — from `siteData.productCatalogData`

## Step 2: Determine margin tier and calculate discount + minSubTotal

Use the average profit margin to select the appropriate discount and threshold tier.

| Margin Tier | Condition | Max Discount | minSubTotal Formula |
|---|---|---|---|
| Low margin | `avg_profit_margin < 25%` | 10% | `1.15 x effective_aov` |
| Medium margin | `25% <= avg_profit_margin <= 50%` | 15% | `1.3 x effective_aov` |
| High margin | `avg_profit_margin > 50%` | 20% | `1.5 x effective_aov` |
| No data | Margin data unavailable | 10% | `1.15 x effective_aov` |

Example: If `effective_aov` = $150 and `avg_profit_margin` = 35% (medium), then max discount = 15% and raw minSubTotal = $195.

---

## Step 3: Round minSubTotal (CRITICAL)

**minSubTotal MUST be rounded UP to the nearest $5 increment** (the result mod 5 must equal 0). Always round UP, never down.

| Raw Value | Rounded Value |
|---|---|
| $195 | $195 (already divisible by 5) |
| $217 | $220 |
| $223 | $225 |
| $199 | $200 |
| $172.50 | $175 |
| $201 | $205 |

Formula: `minSubTotal = ceil(raw_value / 5) * 5`

---

## Step 4: Determine discount scope

Select the scope based on analytics data:

- **CATEGORY** (preferred): When analytics show a clear high-margin category opportunity. Target the category with the highest profit margin that also has sufficient product count.
- **ITEMS**: When specific high-margin products stand out as upsell candidates (max 5 productIds).
- **SITE** (fallback): When no single category or product group dominates, apply catalog-wide.

---

## Step 5: Convert category names to GUIDs (if CATEGORY scope)

If scope is CATEGORY, call `getCategoryIds` to convert human-readable category names into GUIDs. **Never output category names directly as scope IDs.**

Exclude the "All Products" system category — it contains every product and would effectively make the discount site-wide.

Max 3 categoryIds per discount rule.

---

## Step 6: Run guardrail checks

**Run the pre-create guardrails in [Create Discount Rule](https://dev.wix.com/docs/api-reference/business-solutions/e-commerce/skills/pricing-create-discount-rule) → "Guardrails" before creating the rule** — conflict/stacking (scope, time, coupon cross-stacking), the 25% cap, the 15% margin floor, and %-sanity. Present any warnings to the merchant and get confirmation before proceeding.

---

## Step 7: Create the discount rule

**Endpoint**: `POST https://www.wixapis.com/ecom/v1/discount-rules`

**Request** — 15% off orders over $195, scoped to a category:
```json
{
  "discountRule": {
    "name": "Spend $195+, Get 15% Off",
    "active": true,
    "discounts": [
      {
        "discount": {
          "discountType": "PERCENTAGE",
          "percentage": 15
        },
        "scope": {
          "id": "category-guid-here",
          "type": "COLLECTION"
        }
      }
    ],
    "conditions": {
      "subtotalRange": {
        "from": "195.00"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "discountRule": {
    "id": "c3d4e5f6-a7b8-9012-cdef-123456789012",
    "revision": "1",
    "name": "Spend $195+, Get 15% Off",
    "active": true,
    "discounts": [
      {
        "discount": {
          "discountType": "PERCENTAGE",
          "percentage": 15
        },
        "scope": {
          "id": "category-guid-here",
          "type": "COLLECTION"
        }
      }
    ],
    "conditions": {
      "subtotalRange": {
        "from": "195.00"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Request** — site-wide fallback example:
```json
{
  "discountRule": {
    "name": "Spend $175+, Get 10% Off Everything",
    "active": true,
    "discounts": [
      {
        "discount": {
          "discountType": "PERCENTAGE",
          "percentage": 10
        },
        "scope": {
          "id": "catalog",
          "type": "CATALOG"
        }
      }
    ],
    "conditions": {
      "subtotalRange": {
        "from": "175.00"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Save the returned `id` and `revision` for later management.

---

## Step 8: Verify the rule is active

1. Query discount rules to confirm the new rule exists and is `active: true`
2. Verify the minSubTotal condition is correctly set
3. Report to the merchant:
   > "Upsell discount is live: {discount}% off on orders over ${minSubTotal} for {scope description}. This threshold is {percentage}% above your current average order value of ${effective_aov}, designed to incentivize higher spending."

---

## Branching logic

| Merchant intent | Scope | Discount | minSubTotal |
|---|---|---|---|
| "Increase average order value" | Determined by analytics (CATEGORY preferred) | Margin-tiered | Calculated from AOV |
| "Get people to spend more on electronics" | COLLECTION with electronics category GUID | Margin-tiered | Calculated from AOV |
| "20% off orders over $200" (explicit) | As specified by merchant | 20% (user override) | $200 (user override) |
| "Reward big spenders" | CATALOG (site-wide) | Margin-tiered | Calculated from AOV |

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `DISCOUNT_RULE_NOT_FOUND` | Rule ID doesn't exist | Re-query discount rules for current IDs |
| `REVISION_MISMATCH` | Revision doesn't match | Re-fetch rule for latest revision, then retry |
| AOV unavailable | No revenue or order data | Use price_p50 from catalog analytics as AOV proxy |
| Margin data unavailable | No profit margin data in catalog | Default to low-margin tier (10% discount, 1.15x AOV) |
| Category GUID not found | Category name doesn't match any collection | Re-query categories or fall back to SITE scope |
