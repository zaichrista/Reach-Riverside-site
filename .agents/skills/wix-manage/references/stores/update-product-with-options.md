name: "Update Product with Options (Catalog V3)"
description: Modifies existing products and variants using Catalog V3 Products API. Covers adding/removing option choices, variant-specific pricing, product visibility (hide, unhide, or show a product in the storefront — a product-level `visible` update, never a delete), and revision-based updates to prevent conflicts.

**RECIPE**: Business Recipe - Updating a Wix Store Product (Catalog V3)

Use this recipe to update an existing Catalog V3 product: storefront visibility, description, media, options, variants, prices, or stock-related inventory records.

## Before Any Product Update

Every Catalog V3 product update is revision-based:

- If the user gives a product name instead of a product ID, use [Search Products](https://dev.wix.com/docs/api-reference/business-solutions/stores/catalog-v3/products-v3/search-products) and choose the exact product name match.
- Use [Get Product](https://dev.wix.com/docs/api-reference/business-solutions/stores/catalog-v3/products-v3/get-product) to retrieve the current product, its `product.revision`, and its existing variants. Search Products and Query Products responses do not include `variantsInfo.variants`, so a variant or price update assembled from a search result sends an empty variants array and is rejected. Re-read the product before every variant-level update.
- Include `product.id` and the current `product.revision` in every [Update Product](https://dev.wix.com/docs/api-reference/business-solutions/stores/catalog-v3/products-v3/update-product) PATCH body.
- Update Product is a partial update: only `product`, `product.id`, and `product.revision` are required, and top-level fields you omit (for example `name`, `ribbon`, `brand`) are left unchanged. The full-array overwrite rule applies only to the repeated fields `options`, `modifiers`, and `variantsInfo.variants`.
- For simple text/HTML description updates, prefer `plainDescription`. Use `description` only when sending a Rich Content object.

### Find the product by name

```bash
curl -X POST "https://www.wixapis.com/stores/v3/products/search" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: <AUTH>" \
  -d '{
    "search": {
      "expression": "Product name"
    }
  }'
```

For product-name lookup, prefer Search Products before retrieving the product by ID. Search only resolves the product ID; it does not replace the Get Product call.

### Get the current revision

```bash
curl -X GET "https://www.wixapis.com/stores/v3/products/{productId}" \
  -H "Authorization: <AUTH>"
```

## Common Update Patterns

### Hide or Show a Product

"Hide this product", "make it not show in my store", "unhide it", "put it back in the store" are all product-level visibility changes. Set the `visible` boolean on the product in an Update Product PATCH. Do not delete the product, and do not change variant visibility to hide the product.

```bash
curl -X PATCH "https://www.wixapis.com/stores/v3/products/{productId}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: <AUTH>" \
  -d '{
    "product": {
      "id": "{productId}",
      "revision": "{currentRevision}",
      "visible": false
    }
  }'
```

Send `"visible": true` to show it again. Nothing else needs to be in the body — `name`, `options`, `variantsInfo` and the other top-level fields you omit are left unchanged. Confirm the result from `product.visible` in the response.

Visibility behaviour to report back accurately:

- `visible` defaults to `true`.
- For a product **without** options, updating `product.visible` automatically updates the default variant's `visible` to match.
- For a product **with** options, product and variant visibility are independent: setting `product.visible` to `false` leaves each `variantsInfo.variants[].visible` as it was.
- Point-of-sale visibility is a separate field, `visibleInPos`. Only change it when the user asks about POS. It is always `false` for `productType: DIGITAL`.

### Update Description Only

For a normal user request like "set the product description to X", use `plainDescription` with valid HTML. The API converts it to rich content.

Do not send a plain string in `description`. `description` is a Rich Content object.

```bash
curl -X PATCH "https://www.wixapis.com/stores/v3/products/{productId}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: <AUTH>" \
  -d '{
    "product": {
      "id": "{productId}",
      "revision": "{currentRevision}",
      "plainDescription": "<p>A great product for everyone.</p>"
    }
  }'
```

Use `description` only when you intentionally need to send Rich Content:

```bash
curl -X PATCH "https://www.wixapis.com/stores/v3/products/{productId}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: <AUTH>" \
  -d '{
    "product": {
        "id": "{productId}",
        "revision": "{currentRevision}",
        "description": {
            "nodes": [
                {
                    "type": "PARAGRAPH",
                    "id": "description",
                    "nodes": [
                        {
                            "type": "TEXT",
                            "textData": {
                                "text": "Updated product description."
                            }
                        }
                    ],
                    "paragraphData": {
                        "textStyle": {
                            "textAlignment": "AUTO"
                        }
                    }
                }
            ],
            "metadata": {
                "version": 1
            }
        }
    }
  }'
```

### Update Options and Variants

When adding or changing options and variants, send the full option definitions and one variant for each option-choice combination. Use `optionChoiceNames` to reference choices.

```bash
curl -X PATCH "https://www.wixapis.com/stores/v3/products/{productId}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: <AUTH>" \
  -d '{
    "product": {
      "id": "{productId}",
      "revision": "{currentRevision}",
      "options": [
        {
          "name": "Color",
          "optionRenderType": "SWATCH_CHOICES",
          "choicesSettings": {
            "choices": [
              {
                "name": "White",
                "choiceType": "ONE_COLOR",
                "colorCode": "#FFFFFF"
              },
              {
                "name": "Red",
                "choiceType": "ONE_COLOR",
                "colorCode": "#FF0000"
              },
              {
                "name": "Black",
                "choiceType": "ONE_COLOR",
                "colorCode": "#000000"
              }
            ]
          }
        }
      ],
      "variantsInfo": {
        "variants": [
          {
            "choices": [
              {
                "optionChoiceNames": {
                  "optionName": "Color",
                  "choiceName": "White",
                  "renderType": "SWATCH_CHOICES"
                }
              }
            ],
            "price": {
              "actualPrice": {
                "amount": "270.00"
              }
            }
          },
          {
            "choices": [
              {
                "optionChoiceNames": {
                  "optionName": "Color",
                  "choiceName": "Red",
                  "renderType": "SWATCH_CHOICES"
                }
              }
            ],
            "price": {
              "actualPrice": {
                "amount": "270.00"
              }
            }
          },
          {
            "choices": [
              {
                "optionChoiceNames": {
                  "optionName": "Color",
                  "choiceName": "Black",
                  "renderType": "SWATCH_CHOICES"
                }
              }
            ],
            "price": {
              "actualPrice": {
                "amount": "270.00"
              }
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }'
```

When updating existing variants, include each existing variant `id`. If no GUID is passed, a variant is created with a new GUID. Each variant object is replaced whole rather than merged, so carry over the fields you are not changing: rebuilding a variant from just its `id` plus the field you want to set drops everything else and is rejected on the first required field it lost (`price must not be empty`). Start from the variant as returned by Get Product and override only what the user asked to change.

### Renaming an Existing Choice Is Not Supported

`options[].choicesSettings.choices` is immutable once a choice exists — this includes the choice's own `name`. If the user asks to rename, fix a typo in, or standardize the name of an **existing** option choice (for example a shared/reusable customization like "Color" or "Patch Design" that already has variants), do not attempt an Update Product or Update Customization PATCH: it returns `200`, `product.revision`/`customization.revision` increments, but the name is silently left unchanged — confirm this yourself with a fresh Get Product/Get Customization call and you will still see the old name. There is currently no endpoint that renames an existing choice, even when you pass back the same `choiceId` and preserve every other choice, option, and variant exactly.

Do not try workarounds that risk the existing variant matrix — do not delete and recreate the choice/option (this destroys all variants using it, along with their prices, SKUs, and inventory), and do not use Set Customization Choices (it fails once the choice is assigned to any product). Tell the user this specific rename isn't possible via the API today and that manually renaming the choice in the Wix dashboard (Site → Products → the product's options) is the only way, or point them to `SupportAndFeedback` to report the gap.

This only blocks renaming an *existing* choice. Adding brand-new choices to an option (Add/Bulk Add Customization Choices, or including a new choice name in a full Update Product `options` payload) works normally.

### Convert a Simple Product to Color Variants

When adding the first option to a simple product, do not preserve a choice-less default variant unchanged. A simple product often has one existing variant with price or stock but no `choices`. After you add a `Color` option, every variant in `variantsInfo.variants` must include choices that match the product options.

Use the existing default variant as source data only. For example, copy its price if the user did not ask to change price, then send a complete optioned variants list where each variant has:

```json
{
  "choices": [
    {
      "optionChoiceNames": {
        "optionName": "Color",
        "choiceName": "Red",
        "renderType": "SWATCH_CHOICES"
      }
    }
  ],
  "price": {
    "actualPrice": {
      "amount": "{existingOrRequestedPrice}"
    }
  }
}
```

After the product update returns the new variant IDs, use those IDs to set inventory.

### Set Stock for New Variants

Inventory is handled separately from product updates. After the product update returns variant IDs, use [Bulk Create Inventory Items](https://dev.wix.com/docs/api-reference/business-solutions/stores/catalog-v3/inventory-items-v3/bulk-create-inventory-items) with `productId`, `variantId`, and `quantity`.

If the store has multiple inventory locations, include `locationId`; otherwise the store's default location is used.
After bulk inventory create, check `bulkActionMetadata.totalSuccesses` and `results[].itemMetadata.success`. Returned inventory entities are under `results[].item`, not a top-level `inventoryItems` field; confirm stock from `results[].item.quantity`.

```bash
curl -X POST "https://www.wixapis.com/stores/v3/bulk/inventory-items/create" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: <AUTH>" \
  -d '{
    "inventoryItems": [
      {
        "productId": "{productId}",
        "variantId": "{redVariantId}",
        "quantity": 10
      },
      {
        "productId": "{productId}",
        "variantId": "{blueVariantId}",
        "quantity": 10
      }
    ],
    "returnEntity": true
  }'
```

### Update Media Only

Sets the product-level gallery (`media.itemsInfo.items`). For an image shown per option choice (a swatch's photo), see **Per-choice media** below.

```bash
curl -X PATCH "https://www.wixapis.com/stores/v3/products/{productId}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: <AUTH>" \
  -d '{
    "product": {
      "id": "{productId}",
      "revision": "{currentRevision}",
      "media": {
        "itemsInfo": {
          "items": [
            {
              "url": "https://static.wixstatic.com/media/your-image.jpg",
              "altText": "Product image"
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  }'
```

### Choice & variant fields (what you can set)

Send these inside the `options` / `variantsInfo.variants` arrays — **both arrays complete, in the
same PATCH**, with the current `revision`, and **identity-preserving** (see *Update Options and
Variants*): keep the option's `id` and every `choiceId`, or the ids are re-minted and the existing
variants no longer resolve (`400 "Variant choice not found in product options"`). Each variant needs
its `id`, its `choices` (by `optionChoiceIds` — or `optionChoiceNames`, see *Gotchas*) **and** a
`price` — omitting price is `400 "price must not be empty"`.

**Option choice** (`options[].choicesSettings.choices[]`):
- `name`, `choiceType`, `colorCode` — the choice's identity and swatch colour.
- `media` = `{ "items": [ { "mediaId" } | { "url" } ] }` — the product photos shown when this choice is picked. `url` is write-only; on read you get `mediaId` (request the `PRODUCT_CHOICES_MEDIA_REFERENCES` mask). Use `media`, **not** `linkedMedia` (a separate display-filter, returned empty when you read `media`).
  - **Gallery-first; the id you link is the gallery item's, not the upload's.** Add the `url` to the gallery, then read the product back and link the id you see there:

    ```
    GET /stores/v3/products/{id}?fields=MEDIA_ITEMS_INFO
    #  → media.itemsInfo.items[].id = "abc~mv2.jpg"   ← link THIS as choice media.items[].mediaId
    # the id from POST /site-media/v1/files/import or /files/get-file-by-id 400s as a choice mediaId
    ```
    `{ "url" }` works in place of `{ "mediaId" }` too, but only once the image is already in the gallery.
- `displayImage` — the image shown on the swatch itself (distinct from `media`).
- Read-only, don't send: `inStock`, `visible`, `key`.

**Variant** (`variantsInfo.variants[]`, by its `id` from Get Product; always send `choices` + `price` with it):
- `price` = `{ "actualPrice": { "amount" }, "compareAtPrice": { "amount" } }` — set `compareAtPrice` above `actualPrice` for a strikethrough sale; omit it for full price.
- `sku`, `barcode` — per combination.
- `visible` — hide a single variant.
- `revenueDetails` — cost / profit tracking.
- Read-only, don't send: `media` (derived from the choices' media), `inventoryStatus` (stock — use the Inventory API, see *Set Stock for New Variants*), `subscriptionPricesInfo`.

```bash
# A choice image + a variant's sale price, one PATCH. Both arrays are complete and keep their ids —
# this exact shape is the one that succeeds; the two shortcuts (choices by name only, or a variant
# without its choices/price) each 400.
curl -X PATCH "https://www.wixapis.com/stores/v3/products/{productId}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: <AUTH>" \
  -d '{ "product": { "id": "{productId}", "revision": "{currentRevision}",
        "options": [ { "id": "{optionId}", "name": "Color", "optionRenderType": "COLOR_CHOICES",
          "choicesSettings": { "choices": [
            { "choiceId": "{choiceId1}", "name": "Red", "choiceType": "ONE_COLOR", "colorCode": "#C0392B",
              "media": { "items": [ { "mediaId": "abc~mv2.jpg" } ] } },
            { "choiceId": "{choiceId2}", "name": "Blue", "choiceType": "ONE_COLOR", "colorCode": "#2C3E50" } ] } } ],
        "variantsInfo": { "variants": [
          { "id": "{variantId1}", "sku": "TEE-RED-L",
            "price": { "actualPrice": { "amount": "20" }, "compareAtPrice": { "amount": "30" } },
            "choices": [ { "optionChoiceIds": { "optionId": "{optionId}", "choiceId": "{choiceId1}" } } ] },
          { "id": "{variantId2}", "price": { "actualPrice": { "amount": "20" } },
            "choices": [ { "optionChoiceIds": { "optionId": "{optionId}", "choiceId": "{choiceId2}" } } ] } ] } } }'
```

### Update Variant Price Only

Read `{existingVariantId}` off the Get Product response; a Search or Query Products result does not carry it.

```bash
curl -X PATCH "https://www.wixapis.com/stores/v3/products/{productId}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: <AUTH>" \
  -d '{
    "product": {
      "id": "{productId}",
      "revision": "{currentRevision}",
      "variantsInfo": {
        "variants": [
          {
            "id": "{existingVariantId}",
            "price": {
              "actualPrice": {
                "amount": "29.99"
              }
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }'
```

### Attach a Digital File

A `DIGITAL` product is **sellable** only when its variant carries both a digital file and stock. Upload the file first ([Upload Media to Wix](../media/upload-media-to-wix.md) → Generate Upload URL, then `PUT` the bytes), then send its `file.id` on the variant — `digitalProperties` is a variant field, never a product field.

```bash
curl -X PATCH "https://www.wixapis.com/stores/v3/products/{productId}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: <AUTH>" \
  -d '{
    "product": {
      "id": "{productId}",
      "revision": "{currentRevision}",
      "variantsInfo": {
        "variants": [
          {
            "id": "{existingVariantId}",
            "price": { "actualPrice": { "amount": "9.99" } },
            "visible": true,
            "inventoryItem": { "inStock": true },
            "digitalProperties": { "digitalFile": { "id": "{fileId}" } }
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }'
```

Confirm from `product.variantsInfo.variants[].digitalProperties.digitalFile` in the response.

## Important Notes

- A request to hide a product is a `visible: false` update on the product, never a Delete Product call and never a variant-only change.
- To update array fields like `options`, `modifiers`, `variantsInfo.variants`, and any others, pass the entire existing array. Passing only the changed item overwrites the whole array.
- To update `variantsInfo.variants`, also pass `options`, and vice versa. Variants and options are mutually dependent and must stay aligned.
- When converting a simple product to an optioned product, rebuild the variants list so every variant has `choices`; do not keep an existing choice-less default variant unchanged.
- Always include `choicesSettings` with the complete list of choices when updating a product with options.
- An existing choice's `name` can't be changed via Update Product or Update Customization. The request succeeds and revision increments, but the rename is silently dropped — see "Renaming an Existing Choice Is Not Supported" above.
- Use `optionChoiceNames` rather than `optionChoiceIds` in variants for more reliable updates. Reading them back is not symmetric: Get Product returns each variant's `choices` with `optionChoiceIds` only, and fills in `optionChoiceNames` just when the request's `fields` array includes `"VARIANT_OPTION_CHOICE_NAMES"`. So to find the variant for a named choice such as `Large`, either pass that field and match on the name, or take the choice GUID from `options[].choicesSettings.choices[].choiceId` and match it against `variants[].choices[].optionChoiceIds.choiceId`. Matching on a name the response never carried raises nothing — it just selects no variant.
- Include the `renderType` in `optionChoiceNames`.

## Error Message Reference
