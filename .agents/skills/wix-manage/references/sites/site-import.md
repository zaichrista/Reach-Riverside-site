name: "Site Import"
description: Drive the Wix Site Import agent to migrate an existing store or site from another platform (Shopify, WooCommerce, Magento, or any URL) into Wix — as a brand-new site or into the user's existing one — or to import from CSV/TSV export files with no source site. Use this skill whenever the user wants to import, migrate, or clone a store/site into Wix, mentions moving off Shopify/WooCommerce/Magento, or gives a source store URL and asks to bring it into Wix. Covers starting the import, polling progress, answering the agent's mid-import questions, handling deploy/failure/auth-expiry states, and sending post-deploy follow-up changes.

# Site Import

Drives an autonomous Wix-hosted import agent over REST to migrate a store/site
from another platform into Wix. You act as the relay between the user and the
agent: start the job, poll it, surface its questions and progress like a chat,
and report the final result.

## Golden rules — apply to every single message

1. **Only `DEPLOYED` means the site is live.** Any other status — including
   `AUTH_EXPIRED` — means there is NO finished site yet. Never declare
   success, completion, or "your site is live" otherwise, and never present a
   URL from any other source as the result.
2. **Show the user the `importId` after Start succeeds** — share it as a
   reference they can use to check back. Never show raw JSON or HTTP codes.
3. **Never offer menus of monitoring or technical options** — pick the right
   behavior yourself and do it quietly.
4. **Plain language only** — write for a shopkeeper, not an engineer.
5. **This API is the only site-creation tool for this task** — never
   substitute other Wix site-builder tools (see Scope).

Base URL: `https://www.wixapis.com/site-import`. A full import typically takes
15–60 minutes.

## Calling the API

This API is **deliberately not listed in the public Wix REST documentation**,
so do NOT search the Wix docs / API spec for it — the search will come up
empty every time. That is expected and is NOT a reason to stop, ask the user
for "special permissions", or switch to a different import product. This
skill is the documentation; the endpoints below are real and live.

**Make the first API call immediately — no preamble.** Never announce "let me
check the tools" or "checking auth" before the first call. If Start returns
an error, handle it per the Rules section — **never probe other endpoints**
(e.g. site-properties, site-list) to "verify auth"; those calls reveal
nothing useful.

**All calls are server-side.** Never call this API from an artifact, a web
page, or any client-side code — those fail with CORS. The entire experience
is plain chat — API calls plus short messages.

Use the Wix REST API tool available in your environment with the **full
URL** (account-level, or site-scoped with a target `siteId` — see Start
below for when each applies). Start, Send-a-message, and Cancel are mutating
(POST); Poll is read-only (GET).

Example — Start, account-level (creates a new site):

```
POST https://www.wixapis.com/site-import/v1/imports
Body: {
  "request": "Import https://example-store.com into a new Wix site",
  "source_url": "https://example-store.com"
}
```

Example — Start, site-scoped (imports into the user's existing site — same
body, plus a `wix-site-id` header naming the destination site; see the
Destination note under Start below):

```
POST https://www.wixapis.com/site-import/v1/imports
Headers: { "wix-site-id": "<destination siteId>" }
Body: {
  "request": "Import https://example-store.com into my site",
  "source_url": "https://example-store.com"
}
```

Example — Start from exported files (no source site, FILE run):

```
POST https://www.wixapis.com/site-import/v1/imports
Body: {
  "request": "Import these product export files into a new Wix site",
  "fileUrls": ["https://example.com/exports/products.csv"]
}
```

Example — Poll:

```
GET https://www.wixapis.com/site-import/v1/imports/<importId>?includeRecentActivity=true
```

Example — Poll fetching a review document:

```
GET https://www.wixapis.com/site-import/v1/imports/<importId>?includeRecentActivity=true&artifactIds=mapping-summary,mapping-plan
```

Example — Send a message:

```
POST https://www.wixapis.com/site-import/v1/imports/<importId>/messages
Body: { "message": "Use the blue logo from the About page instead" }
```

## Scope — this skill drives the import service, nothing else

While an import is the task at hand, ALL site-creation work goes through this
API. Never fall back to other site-building tools (site-builder/template/AI
site-generation tools) to "compensate" — not when the import is slow, and
especially not when it FAILS.

**Status comes ONLY from this API's Poll endpoint.** Never call another
site-building or site-creation capability to "check on the build" — some
such tools start a new site build on every call, even when asked only for
status. A failed import ends with a clear failure report and a full stop; the user
must never discover a different site in their account that they didn't ask
for. If an alternative makes sense, propose it AFTER reporting the failure
and act only on the user's explicit yes.

## Before starting an import

This creates real infrastructure and writes to the user's Wix account. Before
calling **Start**, confirm:
- The source URL and platform are correct — or, for a file-only import, the
  export file URL(s) are correct
- The user understands it runs for up to ~60 minutes and may ask questions mid-way
- Which destination they want: a brand-new site, or their existing site by id
  (site-scoped) — this can't be changed once Start is called. Importing into
  an existing site writes into it directly and can add or overwrite its
  current pages and content, so make sure they understand that before you
  proceed — it isn't a safe side-by-side preview.
  **If they want their existing site but haven't given a `siteId`, resolve
  it yourself first** — from the account/site context already available to
  you, or by querying the account's sites (see the Query Sites skill) — and
  ask the user to pick when more than one candidate matches what they
  described. Never guess a `siteId` or silently default to an account-level
  call just because none was supplied.

Also confirm before calling **Cancel** — it's irreversible.

## What the user sees (presentation rules)

You are the user experience; the API is plumbing. Keep the protocol invisible:

- **Show the `importId` once, right after Start succeeds** — e.g. "Your import
  ID is `abc123` — keep it handy." Never show raw JSON, HTTP codes, artifact
  ids, or `sourcePlatform`/`sourceConfidence`/`destinationSiteId` values.
- **Write for a non-technical audience.** No jargon: no "endpoint", "API",
  "poll", "HTTP", "rate limit", "JSON". Translate events into plain outcomes —
  "the source store limits how fast it can be read" not "hit rate limit (429)".
- **Monitor autonomously — never ask the user whether to keep monitoring.**
  Poll every ~30 seconds until a terminal status arrives. If the user sends a
  message about something else, handle it then resume polling. Match your
  environment:
  - **Background polling**: speak up only on meaningful milestones — platform
    identified, plan step completes, agent asks a question, site deploys, or
    something fails. Never narrate each poll or transient errors.
  - **Turn-based**: end each turn with one concrete progress update. On every
    later user message, poll first. **Do not end a turn asking whether to keep
    checking** — just keep checking.
- **Status answers must be substantive.** Never answer "still in progress".
  Relay `message` (lightly rephrased) and anything fresh from `recentActivity`
  / `todos`. If `message` is empty, say the import is still setting up.
- **Never announce or describe the monitoring itself.** After the one-sentence
  start message, stay silent until the first milestone.
- **Keep routine updates to 1–3 short sentences.** No headers, emoji walls, or
  bullet lists for ordinary progress.
- On start, two short sentences: (1) import underway, mention detected platform
  when it helps; (2) share the `importId`. Never say "confidence", "sandbox",
  "execution", or "session".
- Progress updates: rephrase `recentActivity` `TEXT` entries and `todos` in
  plain language; never echo verbatim.
- Ask `NEEDS_INPUT` questions conversationally, as if they were your own.
- On `DEPLOYED`, lead with the live URL, then a plain-language summary of what
  the user got, honest limitations, and 2–3 short follow-up offers. Leave out
  frameworks, SDKs, and anything from the jargon list.
- On `FAILED` / `AUTH_EXPIRED` / `SESSION_EXPIRED`, explain what happened in
  plain words — no codes, no id dumps.
- **A failure is the headline, never a footnote.** The moment a poll returns
  `FAILED`, your very next message leads with that fact and the reason — never
  bury it or paper over it with other tools.

## Endpoints

**Single `importId` for the whole import — assigned at Start, never changes.**

1. **Start** — `POST /v1/imports`
   Body: `{"request": "<natural language; MUST include the source store URL when crawling a live site>", "source_url": "<the source store URL>", "fileUrls": ["<CSV/TSV export URL>", ...]}`
   `request` is required (1–20000 chars). `source_url` and `fileUrls` are both
   optional, but send whichever applies — never leave both out with no way to
   identify what to import:
   - **`source_url`** — send it whenever the user names a site to crawl. It's
     the identity the service uses to select which migration the request joins,
     not just an extra hint.
   - **`fileUrls`** — send it when the user has CSV/TSV export file(s) to import
     instead of crawling a live site. Setting it makes this a **FILE run**: no
     source site is probed and no source credentials are requested, even if
     `source_url` is also present — `source_url` only changes what the
     migration is keyed on (see below), it does not add a crawl on top of the
     file import. Up to 20 URLs, http/https only (ports 80/443), each ≤2048
     chars. If `source_url` is absent, the file set itself is the migration
     identity — re-sending the same URLs continues the same migration; a
     different set starts a new one. If a URL isn't reachable, the whole call
     is rejected with `INVALID_FILE_URL` (nothing is silently dropped).
   - A request with neither `source_url` nor a URL/site identifiable in
     `request`, and no `fileUrls`, is rejected with `SITE_UNIDENTIFIED`.
   Returns: `importId`, `sourcePlatform`, `sourceConfidence`, `destinationSiteId`.
   `sourcePlatform` comes back as `CSV` for a FILE run (no site was probed, so
   `sourceConfidence` is meaningless there).
   **Destination (new site vs. an existing site) is decided by call scope, not
   a body field:** account-level (no site context) always creates a brand-new
   site — the default when the user has none yet or wants a fresh one;
   site-scoped (adding a `wix-site-id: <siteId>` header, same body — see the
   examples above) writes into that existing site instead. Ask the user which
   they want before calling Start — it can't change afterward. Get this
   wrong at Start and you'll silently create an unwanted second site instead
   of writing into the one they meant. Once Start has scoped the import,
   keep sending that same `wix-site-id` header on every later call for that
   `importId` (Poll, Send-a-message, Cancel included) — it won't create
   another site at this point, but omitting it will fail authorization
   against the site-scoped import. `destinationSiteId` in the
   response echoes this (empty = new site, set = that existing site), returned
   as soon as Start succeeds, even before a source is confirmed.
   **One import per store at a time, keyed on `source_url` (or the file set
   when there's no `source_url`) together with call scope** — account-level
   and a given `wix-site-id` are different keys even for the identical
   `source_url`/file set: re-starting with the same identity (same source
   AND same scope) continues the SAME migration (server returns the
   existing `importId`, no new import created). A different identity —
   a different source, a different file set, or the same source at a
   *different* call scope — always starts an independent migration, even
   for the same user. This is why getting the scope wrong at Start matters
   (see above): re-calling Start with the corrected scope does not fix the
   original import, it starts a second, independent one. To redo a
   mis-scoped import, **Cancel it first**, then Start again with the
   correct scope. If a different user on the account already owns an
   import for that identity, Start returns
   `409 { "code": "IMPORT_IN_PROGRESS" }` — tell the user and stop.

2. **Poll** — `GET /v1/imports/{importId}?includeRecentActivity=true`
   Returns: `status`, `deployUrl`, `message`, `options[]` (only when
   `NEEDS_INPUT`), `recentActivity[]`, `recentActivityCount`, `todos[]`,
   `artifacts[]`.
   **Always pass `includeRecentActivity=true`** — the activity feed is withheld
   unless requested. To read a review document, add
   `&artifactIds=mapping-plan,mapping-gaps` (see "Review documents").

3. **Send a message** — `POST /v1/imports/{importId}/messages`
   Body: `{"message": "<whatever the user said>"}`
   **This is the ONE way anything the user says reaches the agent** — an answer
   to a question, a comment, a correction, or a new instruction. Valid at any
   point: while `IMPORTING`, at a `NEEDS_INPUT` stop, and after the import
   finishes. Returns the **same `importId`** — keep polling it.

4. **Cancel** — `POST /v1/imports/{importId}/cancel`
   Body: `{}`. Only meaningful while status is `IMPORTING`.

## How to run the flow

- After Start, poll every ~30 seconds while `status` is `IMPORTING`. Never
  pause to ask the user whether to keep monitoring — just keep going. Stop
  only on a terminal status (`DEPLOYED`, `FAILED`, `CANCELLED`) or explicit
  cancel.
- Track progress from:
  - `recentActivity`: up to 20 `{kind, text}` entries, oldest first. `TEXT`
    entries are the agent's messages; `TOOL_USE` are action labels. Rolling
    window — track which entries you've covered to avoid repeating them.
  - `todos`: `{content, status, activeForm}` — `PENDING | IN_PROGRESS |
    COMPLETED`. Full snapshot each poll; replace, don't append.
  - Empty `recentActivity`/`todos`/`artifacts` in early polls is normal — these
    are best-effort and the agent may not have produced them yet.
- Act on `status`:
  - `IMPORTING` — keep polling.
  - `NEEDS_INPUT` — agent is blocked. Show `message` (and `options` if present)
    to the user, collect their answer, send it with Send-a-message, then keep
    polling the same `importId`. The user may answer in free text even when
    `options` lists suggested answers. If `message` mentions review documents,
    read them FIRST (see "Review documents") — the decision usually depends on them.
  - `DEPLOYED` — terminal success. Deliver `deployUrl` and `message` per
    presentation rules.
  - `FAILED` — terminal. Relay `message` in plain words.
  - `AUTH_EXPIRED` — recoverable, NOT success, nothing is live (golden rule 1).
    Tell the user the connection to their account expired and you're restarting,
    then call Start again with the same request, using the same call scope
    (account-level, or the same `wix-site-id`) as the original Start — work so
    far is preserved.
  - `CANCELLED` — terminal.
- **Anything the user says mid-import goes straight to Send-a-message** — no
  need to wait for `NEEDS_INPUT`.
- Follow-up changes after a deploy use the same Send-a-message call. The import
  stays resumable for 7 days; if idle for ~60 minutes the next message revives
  it — do not warn the user about a time limit.
- If Send-a-message returns `409 { "code": "SESSION_EXPIRED" }`, the import
  can no longer be resumed — tell the user and offer a fresh start.

### Review documents

The agent writes review documents at approval gates (mapping plan, gaps list,
execution plan, completion summary). **They exist only in the API response** —
the user has no way to open a file.

- Every poll returns `artifacts[]` as a manifest: `{id, title, format,
  contentBytes}` with `content` **empty**. This is deliberate — documents are
  large and most polls don't need them.
- To read one, poll again with `&artifactIds=<id>[,<id>]`. Those come back with
  `content` filled in (Markdown or JSON).
- **When `message` announces review documents, fetch them and summarize for the
  user in plain language before asking for approval.** Never say "the plan is
  in a file I can't read" or relay a filename as something the user should open.

## Rules

- Single `importId` — assigned at Start, returned unchanged by Send-a-message.
- Never invent a `deployUrl` — only report the one returned with `DEPLOYED`.
- Treat `NEEDS_INPUT` and `AUTH_EXPIRED` as normal conversation turns, not
  errors.
- **Site Import is in closed beta, with no self-service enablement path.**
  A `"code": "NOT_ENABLED"` on a `401`, `403`, or `404` from Start always means this
  account isn't in the beta — whether the call was account-level or
  site-scoped. The code isn't always present on an **account-level** call:
  a not-yet-enrolled account's Start has been observed to come back as a
  plain `401`/`403` (`{"message": "The caller is not permitted to perform this
  action."}`, no code) as well as a plain `404` — treat any of those shapes there
  as the beta-lockout case too. Don't probe other endpoints to diagnose it,
  don't retry, and **don't create a site through any other site-building
  capability to compensate — creating a site through a different path is
  not a workaround here, it's the specific mistake this rule exists to
  prevent.** Tell the user plainly and warmly that Site Import is
  currently in a closed beta, that you'd be happy to help once they're
  in, and that they can request access by filling out this short form:
  https://forms.gle/RfZqVRtGCsPv7U7M6 — the team will follow up. Then
  stop, having created nothing.
  **Do not tell them to "contact Wix support"**: this API is unlisted and
  ALPHA, Wix Support has no visibility into it or way to grant access, and the
  public "importing a site created outside of Wix" help-center article is an
  unrelated, long-stalled feature-request page — sending a user to either is a
  dead end. The form above is the only channel that reaches the team.
  **A `401`, `403`, or `404` on a site-scoped call *without* `"code": "NOT_ENABLED"`
  is different** — it means the caller isn't authorized for that `siteId`
  (wrong id, wrong account, no access), not a beta-enrollment issue. Tell
  the user the destination site isn't accessible with their current
  connection and stop; don't send them to the beta form for this.
- For any other unrecognized error or exception on Start — a transient server
  error, a timeout, a rate limit, or anything that isn't the closed-beta case
  above or one of the specific cases below — don't guess that it's a
  beta-enrollment issue and don't retry silently. Tell the user the import
  couldn't be started, share what went wrong in plain language, and stop.
- A `400` on Start means a required field is missing (`request`/`message`
  must be 1–20000 chars), `source_url` exceeds 2048 chars, or `fileUrls` has
  more than 20 entries or one over 2048 chars. A request with no identifiable
  site (no `source_url` and no URL in `request`) and no `fileUrls` is rejected
  with `SITE_UNIDENTIFIED` — ask the user for the store URL or export file(s)
  and retry. A `fileUrls` entry that isn't a reachable http/https URL rejects
  the whole call with `INVALID_FILE_URL` — tell the user which link failed and
  ask for a working one.
- Requesting an unknown id in `artifactIds` is silently ignored — not an error.
  A document simply may not exist yet on an earlier turn.
- **The user cannot open files.** If a message mentions a document by filename,
  fetch it with `artifactIds` and read it to them.
