name: "Analytics Dashboard Navigation"
description: "Builds direct links to Wix Analytics dashboard pages on manage.wix.com — highlights, reports, per-domain overviews (traffic, behavior, sales, marketing), and performance insights/benchmarks. Pairs analytics data with its read API so you can answer a question via API and hand back a 'see it in your dashboard' link. Use when the user asks where something is in the Wix dashboard, wants a direct link to a dashboard page, or you need a dashboard URL to include with the result of an API operation."

# Analytics Dashboard Navigation

Build direct links into the analytics pages of a site's dashboard. For the general URL contract (metaSiteId, fallbacks, redirects), see [Dashboard Navigation](../dashboard-navigation/dashboard-navigation.md).

All Analytics (app ID `3459e2b7-9739-4833-acdd-66e32fc0ab11`) pages live under:

```
https://manage.wix.com/dashboard/{metaSiteId}/analytics/{route}
```

## Main Pages

| Page | URL after `/dashboard/{metaSiteId}/` | What it shows |
|---|---|---|
| Highlights | `analytics/highlights` | Key metrics at a glance |
| Reports | `analytics/reports` | The full report library |
| Traffic overview | `analytics/overviews/traffic` | Sessions, sources, top pages |
| Behavior overview | `analytics/overviews/behavior` | On-site behavior |
| Sales overview | `analytics/overviews/sales` | Revenue and orders |
| Marketing overview | `analytics/overviews/marketing` | Campaign and channel performance |
| Performance insights | `analytics/performance/insights` | Automated insights |
| Benchmarks | `analytics/performance/benchmarks` | Compare against similar sites |

Per-business-solution overviews also exist at `analytics/overviews/{solution}` (`bookings`, `blog`, `subscriptions`).

## Pairing Data with Its Read API

Answer the question with the [Query Site Analytics](../analytics/query-site-analytics.md) recipe (Semantic Model API — `GET /analytics/semantic-model/v3/semantic-models`, `POST .../semantic-models/query-data`), then link the matching overview page.

Example:

```
Your site had 1,240 sessions this week (up 18%).

```
