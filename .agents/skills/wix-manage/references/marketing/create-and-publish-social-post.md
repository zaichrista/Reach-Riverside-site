name: "Create and Publish a Social Media Post (with AI generation)"
description: "End-to-end flow to create a social media post, optionally generating it with AI, and publish or schedule it to a site's connected channel (Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, X/Twitter, TikTok, Pinterest, YouTube, Google Business Profile) using the Wix Publisher API. Can generate a full per-channel post from a free-text idea or from the site's own assets (products, blog posts, events, bookings, coupons, categories), generate caption/title suggestions, and edit an existing image with AI. Settles the post content with you first, then confirms the channel is connected, checks premium quota, creates a draft, and publishes now or schedules it. Use for 'create a post', 'generate a post from my product/idea', 'write a caption', 'caption ideas/suggestions', 'edit a post image with AI', 'post to Instagram/Facebook/TikTok', 'connect my Instagram/Pinterest/LinkedIn', or 'schedule a post'."

# RECIPE: Create and Publish a Social Media Post (with AI generation)

## THE PROTOCOL (read this first — every rule is mandatory)

Run every post request through these steps, in this order. The principle is **value first**: settle *what the post is* and show it to the user before you touch delivery. Don't open with connection or plan checks — reach those only once there's an approved post to deliver. Skip a question only when the user's own words in this conversation already answered it.

1. **Channel + subject first — no API calls yet.** Determine the target channel from the request; if the user didn't name one, ask. Then get, in the user's own words, what the post is **about**: a free-text idea, or a specific site asset (a product, blog post, event, booking, coupon, or category). The subject is a **hard gate** — a reply that answers only part of a question (an account pick, a bare "you decide") does not supply it, and you must never derive a topic from the site's profile or content on your own. Ask again and wait.
2. **Ask: own or generated?** "Do you already have the post text (and image), or should I generate it?" Wait for the answer.
3. **If generating, ask: idea or asset?** "From an idea, or built around one of your site's assets (a product, blog post, event, booking, coupon, or category)?" Offer the asset option explicitly, every time. Wait for the answer.
4. **Route exactly one way:**
   - User has their own text → use it **verbatim**; skip generation → go to STEP 3 (choose type), then STEP 6 (assemble).
   - Idea → `generate-post-data` with `userInput` (STEP 2a; returns caption **and** image).
   - Asset → resolve the asset id, then `generate-post-data` with `siteAssets` (STEP 2a).
   - User explicitly wants **only** a caption → `generate-text` (STEP 2b).
   - User wants an **existing image edited** → `generate-image` (STEP 2c; requires a source image URL).

   To get an **AI image from a bare idea**, that's `generate-post-data` — it returns a generated image as part of the post. `generate-image` only *edits* an existing image (it returns 400 without a source image); there is no endpoint that turns a prompt into a standalone image.
5. **Show it and get approval.** Present the tool's actual output — the caption **and** the image (rendered inline, or its URL). Never hand-write the caption or claim generated content you didn't get from the API. Get explicit approval on the final post **before** any delivery step.
6. **Only now, check delivery — just-in-time.** After the user approves, confirm the channel is connected (STEP 4; connect if needed) and check the plan for publish vs. schedule (STEP 5). This is where connection/plan problems surface — never lead with them. If `SCHEDULE_POST` is disabled, never present scheduling. A positive `quotaInfo.limit` with `remainingUsage: 0` means that action's quota is used up (offer the other action if enabled — a near-future schedule works like publish-now); `limit: 0` means unmetered, so treat the action as available. AI generation is **never** plan-gated; never tell the user it is.
7. **Publish exactly what was approved.** Create the draft (STEP 6) from the approved content plus the account's IDs, then publish or schedule (STEP 7). For a scheduled time, verify the resolved `scheduledDate` is **strictly in the future** right before the call (a "today at 9am"-style time can resolve to the past). Reuse the approved caption, image, and draft on any retry; never regenerate after approval.

The rest of this recipe is the reference for executing each step.

---

This recipe creates a post — called an **item** — and publishes it to one of a site's connected social channels, or schedules it for a future date. You can generate the post content with AI (STEP 2) or bring your own. Each item targets a single channel, and its `type` and content must match a combination the channel supports.

Base URL for all endpoints: `https://www.wixapis.com/social-publisher/v1`.

**Prerequisites:**
- AI generation (STEP 2) is available on every site — it is **not** plan-gated. Offer it by default; skip it only if the user brings their own caption and media.
- To *deliver* the post, the target channel must be connected by the site owner (checked in STEP 4; connect it there if not) and the plan must allow the action (STEP 5).
- Post media must be a **Wix Media Manager URL** (`static.wixstatic.com`); see **Media handling** in STEP 3. Images edited in STEP 2c are already hosted there.

**Flow (value-first):** STEP 1 settle channel + subject → STEP 2 generate the content (offer this proactively) → STEP 3 choose channel/type → **show the post and get approval** → STEP 4 confirm the channel is connected (connect if needed) → STEP 5 check premium → STEP 6 create the draft → STEP 7 publish or schedule. Generation and approval come first so the user sees value before any connection or plan gate; the delivery checks (STEP 4–5) run just-in-time, right before creating and publishing.

**Not covered here:** editing or analyzing already-published posts, and post analytics/insights.

---

## STEP 1: Decide the channel and subject

No API calls here — this is the conversation that anchors everything else.

- **Channel.** Determine the target channel from the request (`INSTAGRAM`, `FACEBOOK`, `YOUTUBE`, `LINKEDIN`, `PINTEREST`, `GBP`, `TIKTOK`, `TWITTER`). If the user didn't name one, ask which channel to post to. `TWITTER` (X) is available only through **July 31, 2026** — see the cutoff rule in STEP 7.
- **Subject (hard gate).** Get, in the user's own words, what the post is about: a free-text idea, or a specific site asset. Don't proceed to generation without it, and never invent a topic from the site's content.

Then follow THE PROTOCOL rules 2–4 to decide own-vs-generated and idea-vs-asset, and route to the right STEP 2 call.

---

## STEP 2: Generate the post content with AI

AI generation isn't gated by the plan (no premium check applies), so offer it by default. **THE PROTOCOL at the top of this recipe governs this step**: hold the subject gate (rule 1), ask own-or-generated (rule 2), offer idea-or-asset (rule 3), and route per rule 4. Never hand-write the caption or title; producing the post means calling the API below and presenting *its* output.

### 2a. Generate a full post — from an idea and/or the site's own assets

Produces ready-to-use, per-channel payloads that drop into STEP 6. **This is the default** — lead with it for any "create a post" request, offering both the idea-based and asset-based paths.

**API Endpoint:** `POST https://www.wixapis.com/social-publisher/v1/generate-post-data`

- `userInput` — free-text idea to base the post on.
- `siteAssets` — the site's own content to ground the post in, as `{ "id": "<asset-guid>", "type": "<asset-type>" }`. **Exactly one asset per call** (multiple assets aren't supported yet). This recipe doesn't look assets up for you — resolve the `id` from the owning app's query API first, then pick the asset the user meant. The linked method docs are authoritative: read them for the exact request/response, or if an inline call stops working.

  | `type` | Owning app | Endpoint | Docs |
  | --- | --- | --- | --- |
  | `STORES_PRODUCT` | Wix Stores | `POST https://www.wixapis.com/stores/v3/products/query` (body `{ "query": {} }`) | [Query Products](https://dev.wix.com/docs/api-reference/business-solutions/stores/catalog-v3/products-v3/query-products) |
  | `STORES_CATEGORY` | Wix Stores | `POST https://www.wixapis.com/categories/v1/categories/query` — **requires** `treeReference`, e.g. `{ "treeReference": { "appNamespace": "@wix/stores" } }` | [Query Categories](https://dev.wix.com/docs/api-reference/business-solutions/stores/catalog-v3/categories/query-categories) |
  | `STORES_COUPON` | Wix Stores | `POST https://www.wixapis.com/stores/v2/coupons/query` (body `{ "query": {} }`) | [Query Coupons](https://dev.wix.com/docs/api-reference/business-solutions/coupons/coupons/query-coupons) |
  | `BLOG_POST` | Wix Blog | `POST https://www.wixapis.com/blog/v3/posts/query` (body `{ "paging": { "limit": 10 } }`) | [Query Posts](https://dev.wix.com/docs/api-reference/business-solutions/blog/posts-stats/query-posts) |
  | `EVENT` | Wix Events | `POST https://www.wixapis.com/events/v3/events/query` (body `{ "query": { "paging": { "limit": 10 } } }` — `paging.limit` must be > 0) | [Query Events](https://dev.wix.com/docs/api-reference/business-solutions/events/event-management/events-v3/query-events) |
  | `BOOKINGS_SERVICE` | Wix Bookings | `POST https://www.wixapis.com/bookings/v2/services/query` (body `{ "query": {} }`) | [Query Services](https://dev.wix.com/docs/api-reference/business-solutions/bookings/services/services-v2/query-services) |

- `media` — candidate images to include, as `{ "type": "IMAGE", "url": "<public-url>" }` (images only).
- `channels` — which channels to generate for. Omit to get one result for each of `INSTAGRAM`, `FACEBOOK`, `LINKEDIN`, `PINTEREST`, `GBP`, and `TIKTOK`.

Provide `userInput`, `siteAssets`, or both.

**Scope:** this method produces standard image-**post** payloads for the six channels above only. It does **not** generate YouTube content, X/Twitter posts, or story/reel/video formats — for those, use 2b (caption) and 2c (image edit) and assemble the content object yourself in STEP 6.

**Example — from an idea + an image, for Instagram and Facebook:**

```json
{
  "userInput": "Announce our new summer collection of handmade ceramic mugs with a 20% discount this week",
  "media": [{ "type": "IMAGE", "url": "https://static.wixstatic.com/media/cf2434_4b3a2d8eb7f54bc89c0d4524430a2af3~mv2.jpg" }],
  "channels": ["INSTAGRAM", "FACEBOOK"]
}
```

**Example — from a site asset (a Stores product):**

```json
{
  "siteAssets": [{ "id": "f1e4c0a2-9b87-4d31-a6e5-2c8b7f0d1a93", "type": "STORES_PRODUCT" }],
  "channels": ["INSTAGRAM"]
}
```

**Expected response** — one entry per **requested** channel, each holding a channel-specific payload (`instagramPost`, `facebookPost`, …) shaped exactly like the content in STEP 6 (Instagram shown below; the two-channel request above also returns a `facebookPost` entry):

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "channelName": "INSTAGRAM",
      "instagramPost": {
        "mediaWrapper": { "media": [{ "type": "IMAGE", "url": "https://static.wixstatic.com/media/cf2434_...~mv2.jpg" }] },
        "caption": "New summer collection: handmade ceramic mugs ☀️🍶 20% off this week! #HandmadeMugs #CeramicLove"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Use the payload for your chosen channel as the content object in STEP 6. When you pass no `media` of your own, `generate-post-data` returns an AI-generated image in `mediaWrapper.media[]` — review the **whole** payload with the user and surface that media, not just the caption (see STEP 3's approval note). The generated image's URL may live on a temporary external host rather than `static.wixstatic.com`; treat it like any external image — import it to the Media Manager (see **Media handling** in STEP 3) and use the imported URL in the post.

### 2b. Generate only a caption or title

Use when the user just wants caption suggestions to place into a post.

**API Endpoint:** `POST https://www.wixapis.com/social-publisher/v1/generate-text`

`userInput` is required. Options: `channelName`, `tone` (e.g. `professional`, `playful`), `languageCode` (ISO 639-1, e.g. `en`), and `additionalContent` (`url`, `withHashtags`, `addLinkInBio`).

```json
{
  "userInput": "A summer sale on handmade ceramic mugs, 20% off this week",
  "channelName": "INSTAGRAM",
  "tone": "playful",
  "languageCode": "en",
  "additionalContent": { "withHashtags": true }
}
```

**Expected response:** `{ "results": [ { "caption": "…", "title": "…" } ] }`. Put the chosen `caption` (and `title` where the channel uses one) into the content object in STEP 6.

### 2c. Edit an image with AI

Transforms an existing **source image** according to a text prompt (e.g. add a sale banner to a product photo, restyle a background). This is AI image-to-image editing — it requires a source image and does **not** generate an image from a prompt alone. Runs asynchronously.

**API Endpoint:** `POST https://www.wixapis.com/social-publisher/v1/generate-image`

Both `userInput` (prompt) and `imageUrl` (the source image to edit) are required:

```json
{
  "userInput": "Add a bright summer-sale banner to the product photo",
  "imageUrl": "https://static.wixstatic.com/media/cf2434_source-product-photo.jpg"
}
```

**Response:** `{ "status": "OK", "executionId": "b7c2f0a1-4e6d-4a8b-9c3f-2d5e1a7b0c94" }`.

**Poll** for the result: `GET https://www.wixapis.com/social-publisher/v1/generated-image/{executionId}` about every few seconds, for up to ~2 minutes, until `status` is `READY` or `FAILED`:

```json
{ "status": "READY", "imageUrl": "https://static.wixstatic.com/media/cf2434_generated-image.jpg", "fileId": "cf2434_abc123def456~mv2.jpg" }
```

`status` values: `IN_PROGRESS` (keep polling; if still `IN_PROGRESS` after ~2 minutes, stop and report), `READY` (use `imageUrl` — and `fileId` — as the post media), `FAILED`. A `404 GENERATED_IMAGE_NOT_FOUND` means the `executionId` is invalid or expired. The generated image is also saved to the site's "Social Marketing AI Media" Media Manager folder.

---

## STEP 3: Choose the channel and type (then show the post and get approval)

For the target channel from STEP 1, pick the item `type` and the matching content object (from STEP 2's output or the user's own content).

| Channel (`channel.name`) | `type` | Content object | Main content fields |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `INSTAGRAM` | `POST` | `instagramPost` | `caption`, `imageUrl`/`videoUrl` or `mediaWrapper` (media **required**) |
| `INSTAGRAM` | `STORY` | `instagramStory` | `mediaWrapper` (media required) |
| `FACEBOOK` | `POST` | `facebookPost` | `caption`, `pageId`, `imageUrl`/`videoUrl`/`link` or `mediaWrapper` |
| `FACEBOOK` | `REEL` | `facebookReel` | `description`, `pageId`, `videoUrl` or `mediaWrapper` |
| `FACEBOOK` | `STORY` | `facebookStory` | `pageId`, `mediaWrapper` |
| `YOUTUBE` | `VIDEO` | `youtubeVideo` | `title`, `description`, `videoUrl`, `channelId` |
| `YOUTUBE` | `SHORT` | `youtubeShort` | `title`, `description`, `videoUrl`, `channelId` |
| `LINKEDIN` | `POST` | `linkedinPost` | `caption`, `authorId`, `mediaWrapper` or `linkMetadata` |
| `TWITTER` (X) | `POST` | `twitterPost` | `caption`, `imageUrl`/`videoUrl`/`link` or `mediaWrapper` — **available only until July 31, 2026** (see STEP 7) |
| `PINTEREST` | `POST` | `pinterestPost` | `title`, `description`, `boardId`, `link`, `mediaWrapper` |
| `GBP` | `POST` | `gbpPost` | `locationId`, `description` and/or `mediaWrapper`, optional `callToAction` |
| `TIKTOK` | `POST` | `tiktokPhoto` | `title`, `description`, `privacyLevel`, `mediaWrapper` |
| `TIKTOK` | `VIDEO` | `tiktokVideo` | `description`, `privacyLevel`, `mediaWrapper` |

Notes:
- Media items in `mediaWrapper.media[]` are `{ "type": "IMAGE" | "VIDEO", "url": "<public-url>" }`.
- Instagram and story types **require** media (GBP needs `description` and/or media). There's no way to produce a standalone image from a prompt (2c only edits an existing image; 2a returns an image only *as part of* a generated post), so if the user has none and doesn't want a full 2a generation, source one — see **Media handling** below.
- `caption` is the text field for Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, and X/Twitter; `description` for YouTube, Pinterest, Google Business Profile, and TikTok.
- The account-derived IDs (`pageId`, `boardId`, `locationId`, `authorId`, `channelId`, `privacyLevel`) come from the account object fetched in STEP 4b — see the field-path table there.
- TikTok `privacyLevel` must be one of the account's `privacyLevelOptions` (from STEP 4b) — one of `PUBLIC_TO_EVERYONE`, `FOLLOWER_OF_CREATOR`, `MUTUAL_FOLLOW_FRIENDS`, `SELF_ONLY`.
- Text length limits: Instagram `caption` ≤ 2200 (about 30 hashtags / 20 mentions); Pinterest `title` ≤ 100, `description` ≤ 800, `link` ≤ 2048; Google Business Profile `description` ≤ 1500; TikTok photo `title` ≤ 90 and `description` ≤ 4000, TikTok video `description` ≤ 2200. AI-generated captions/titles (STEP 2b) are ≤ 1000.
- GBP `callToAction` (optional) is one of `BOOK`, `ORDER`, `SHOP`, `LEARN_MORE`, `SIGN_UP`.
- `TWITTER` (X) works like any other channel **only through July 31, 2026**; after that it's no longer functional (see STEP 7). Treat an `UNSUPPORTED_CHANNEL` error as authoritative.

**Show the post and get approval (do this before any delivery step).** Once the content and type are settled, present the final post to the user — the caption, the target channel, **and the media**: render the image inline if the surface supports it, otherwise post its URL as a clickable link. Never ask them to approve a post whose image they haven't seen. Only after they approve do you move on to the delivery checks (STEP 4 onward). Publishing is public and can't be undone, so this approval is the gate into delivery.

**Media handling.** Post media **must be a Wix Media Manager URL** — `static.wixstatic.com` for images, `video.wixstatic.com` for videos. Always use one, even for media that came from elsewhere. (The API only validates a generic URL and won't reject a non-Wix link, but don't rely on that: an external URL has to stay reachable when the post publishes — a real risk for scheduled posts — and skips the Media Manager processing channels expect. Treat a Wix URL as required.) In the content object, `url` is that Wix URL; `fileId` is optional when `url` is supplied.

Getting media into the Media Manager:
- **Already there** (a site asset's image, a STEP 2c generated image, or a previously uploaded file) → use its `static.wixstatic.com` `url` directly.
- **A public external URL** (including a 2a AI-generated image on a temp host) → import it; Wix fetches it server-side, no local download: `POST https://www.wixapis.com/site-media/v1/files/import` with `{ "url": "<external-url>", "mimeType": "image/jpeg", "displayName": "post.jpg" }`.
- **A local file (no public URL)** → `POST https://www.wixapis.com/site-media/v1/files/generate-upload-url`, then **`PUT` the raw file bytes to the returned `uploadUrl`** (set `Content-Type` to the file's MIME type); the response returns the file descriptor. See the Media Manager Upload API.

After import/upload the file returns `operationStatus: PENDING` — poll `GET https://www.wixapis.com/site-media/v1/files/{id}` until `operationStatus` is `READY`, then use its `static.wixstatic.com` `url` in the post.

---

## STEP 4: Confirm the channel is connected

The user has approved a post — now check that its channel can receive it. **The connection check is `long-lived-token-status` (4a) — that call alone tells you whether the channel is connected.** `List Accounts` (4b) is a separate step: it fetches the connected account to post to (a precondition for creating the draft — and so for publishing *and* scheduling — not for checking connection). Call them in this order, and only reach 4b once 4a returns `VALID`. (Channel-name placement differs by endpoint: `long-lived-token-status` and `connect-url` take it as a **path** segment; `accounts` and `features` take it as a **query** param.)

A standalone "connect my <channel>" request (no post to create) is also in scope: run STEP 4 and stop once the connection is verified.

### STEP 4a: Check the connection status (do this first)

**API Endpoint:** `GET https://www.wixapis.com/social-publisher/v1/INSTAGRAM/long-lived-token-status` (channel name is a **path** segment)

```json
{ "status": "VALID" }
```

**Decision point** — branch on `status`:
- **`VALID`** → connected. Continue to **STEP 4b** to get the account to post to.
- **`NEVER_CREATED`** → never connected → offer to connect (STEP 4c).
- **`DISCONNECTED`** → was connected, now disconnected → offer to reconnect (STEP 4c).
- **`INVALID`** → connection expired → offer to reconnect (STEP 4c).

Only `VALID` proceeds to `List Accounts`. For every other status, go to STEP 4c and **do not call `List Accounts`** — there's no connected user, so it can only error.

**This is per-channel** — the status tells you only about the channel you queried, nothing about others. Scope statements to that channel ("Pinterest isn't connected yet"); never say "no accounts connected on this site" from a single-channel check.

### STEP 4b: Get the account to publish to (only when status is `VALID`)

Because STEP 4a already confirmed `VALID`, this call returns the connected accounts and won't throw `USER_NOT_EXIST_FOR_CHANNEL`.

**API Endpoint:** `GET https://www.wixapis.com/social-publisher/v1/accounts?channelName=INSTAGRAM` (channel name is a **query** param)

**Expected response** (Instagram — one entry per connected account):

```json
{
  "accounts": [
    { "channelName": "INSTAGRAM", "instagram": { "id": "17841405822304914", "username": "janes.pottery", "settings": { "default": true } } }
  ]
}
```

Each account sits under a channel-specific key (`instagram`, `facebook`, …). Its `id` is `channel.accountId` in STEP 6; some channels carry a **second** ID (page/board/location) that the content object needs — a different value from `accountId`. Read them from these paths:

| Channel | account key | `channel.accountId` | Content-object ID |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Instagram | `instagram` | `instagram.id` | — |
| Facebook | `facebook` | `facebook.id` | `pageId` ← `facebook.page.id` |
| YouTube | `youtube` | `youtube.id` | `channelId` ← `youtube.id` (same value) |
| LinkedIn | `linkedin` | `linkedin.id` | `authorId` ← `linkedin.id` (already a URN, e.g. `urn:li:person:…` or `urn:li:organization:…`) |
| X (Twitter) | `twitter` | `twitter.id` | — |
| Pinterest | `pinterest` | `pinterest.id` | `boardId` ← `pinterest.board.id` |
| GBP | `gbp` | `gbp.id` | `locationId` ← `gbp.location.id` |
| TikTok | `tiktok` | `tiktok.id` | `privacyLevel` ∈ `tiktok.privacyLevelOptions` |

**Example — Facebook account** (note `accountId` and `pageId` are different values):

```json
{ "accounts": [ { "channelName": "FACEBOOK", "facebook": {
  "id": "1022334455667788",
  "displayName": "Jane's Pottery",
  "page": { "id": "102938475610293", "displayName": "Jane's Pottery Page" },
  "settings": { "default": true }
} } ] }
```

Here `channel.accountId` = `facebook.id` (`1022334455667788`) and `facebookPost.pageId` = `facebook.page.id` (`102938475610293`).

**Decision point:**
- **One account returned** → use its `id` as `channel.accountId` (plus the second ID above where the channel needs one).
- **Several accounts returned** (one per connected page/account) → pick the one with `settings.default: true`, or ask the user which page/account to post to. To **change the default** (what the dashboard's page picker does), call **Update Account Settings**: `PATCH https://www.wixapis.com/social-publisher/v1/{channelName}/settings` with the channel-specific default field:
  - Instagram → `{ "instagram": { "defaultAccountId": "<id>" } }`
  - Facebook → `{ "facebook": { "defaultPageId": "<id>" } }`
  - Pinterest → `{ "pinterest": { "defaultBoardId": "<id>" } }`
  - Google Business Profile → `{ "gbp": { "defaultLocationId": "<id>" } }`
  - TikTok → `{ "tiktok": { "defaultAccountId": "<id>" } }`
  - LinkedIn → `{ "linkedin": { "defaultChannelId": "<id>" } }`
- **`accounts` is empty (or `NO_PAGES_FOR_USER`) even though STEP 4a returned `VALID`** → the token exists but no postable page/account was granted during authorization (e.g. no Facebook Page with a linked Instagram **Business/Creator** account). Treat it as "not connected": re-run STEP 4c and tell the user to grant the Page.
- **A `400 USER_NOT_EXIST_FOR_CHANNEL` error** (shouldn't happen after a `VALID` status, but possible if the channel was disconnected between calls) → treat exactly like "not connected" for **this channel only** and offer STEP 4c.

### STEP 4c: Connect the channel (only if not connected)

Ask the user if they'd like to connect the channel now. If yes, run the OAuth connect flow — the site owner must authorize in their browser; it can't be completed server-side alone.

1. **Get the authorization URL** — `GET https://www.wixapis.com/social-publisher/v1/INSTAGRAM/connect-url` (path segment is the channel name):

   ```json
   { "connectUrl": "https://www.instagram.com/oauth/authorize?client_id=...&redirect_uri=...&state=..." }
   ```

   A `428 INELIGIBLE_FOR_FEATURE` here means the site has hit its plan's cap on **how many** channels it can connect (free plans allow one), not that this channel is blocked. Since the cap is full, another channel is already connected — offer only two options: **upgrade the plan**, or **post to the already-connected channel** (find it via `List Accounts` on the other channels, or ask). Don't suggest connecting a different new channel (same cap, same 428) or disconnecting the existing one.

2. **Surface `connectUrl` to the user** and ask them to open it and authorize the channel. The channel's OAuth redirect completes the connection server-side.

3. **Poll the connection status** — `GET https://www.wixapis.com/social-publisher/v1/INSTAGRAM/long-lived-token-status` every few seconds, for up to ~2 minutes, until `status` is `VALID`:

   ```json
   { "status": "VALID" }
   ```

   `status` values: `NEVER_CREATED` (not connected yet — keep polling until the timeout), `VALID` (connected — proceed), `INVALID` (connection expired — reconnect with the same flow), `DISCONNECTED` (was disconnected — reconnect). If it's still not `VALID` after ~2 minutes, stop and tell the user the connection wasn't completed and they can retry.

4. **If this was a standalone connect request, stop here** — the channel is connected. Otherwise, run **STEP 4b** (`List Accounts`) to get the now-connected account's `id` for `channel.accountId`. (The poll already confirmed `VALID`, so no need to re-check status.)

If the user declines to connect, stop: the post can't be delivered to an unconnected channel.

---

## STEP 5: Check premium features

One call tells you what the site's plan allows — whether you can publish or schedule — so you fail fast before creating anything. (AI generation is **not** gated by this call — see STEP 2 — so there's no need to check for it here.)

**API Endpoint:** `GET https://www.wixapis.com/social-publisher/v1/features?featureTypes=PUBLISH_POST&featureTypes=SCHEDULE_POST`

**Expected response:**

```json
{
  "features": [
    { "type": "PUBLISH_POST", "enabled": true, "quotaInfo": { "limit": 30, "currentUsage": 4, "remainingUsage": 26, "period": "MONTH" } },
    { "type": "SCHEDULE_POST", "enabled": true, "quotaInfo": { "limit": 30, "currentUsage": 4, "remainingUsage": 26, "period": "MONTH" } }
  ],
  "monetizationEnabled": true
}
```

`period` is one of `NO_PERIOD`, `MILLISECOND`, `SECOND`, `MINUTE`, `HOUR`, `DAY`, `WEEK`, `MONTH`, `YEAR` (`NO_PERIOD` means the quota doesn't reset).

**"Available, no real cap" shows up two ways** — treat both as available: either the entry carries **no `quotaInfo`** at all (`monetizationEnabled: false`, so quotas aren't enforced — rely on `enabled`), or it carries a `quotaInfo` of all-zeros (`limit: 0`, `currentUsage: 0`) from the unlimited-plan misreport.

**Decision point:**
- The action you'll use — `PUBLISH_POST` (publish now) or `SCHEDULE_POST` (schedule) — `enabled: false` → the plan doesn't include it; advise upgrading the social media marketing plan.
- **If `SCHEDULE_POST` is `enabled: false`, drop scheduling from the conversation entirely** — treat "publish now" as the only action. Don't offer a "publish now or schedule?" choice anywhere in the flow, and don't present scheduling while noting it's unavailable. At most mention once that scheduling would need a plan upgrade.
- `monetizationEnabled: true`, a **positive** `quotaInfo.limit`, and `remainingUsage: 0` → quota used up; don't attempt the action (it fails with a 428). Say when it resets (`period`, unless `NO_PERIOD`), offer the alternative action if it's enabled (e.g. publish-now exhausted + scheduling enabled → offer to schedule, even for a few minutes ahead), and mention upgrading once.
- `quotaInfo` with `limit: 0` / `currentUsage: 0` → **unmetered**, not blocked (see above). Treat the action as available and proceed.
- Otherwise → proceed.

## STEP 6: Create the draft item

Create the approved post as a draft. The response returns the draft's `id`, which STEP 7 publishes.

**API Endpoint:** `POST https://www.wixapis.com/social-publisher/v1/items`

Build the request from `item.channel` (`name` + the `accountId` from STEP 4b), `item.type` (from the STEP 3 table), and exactly one channel-specific content object.

**Assembling the content object:**
- If you generated with **STEP 2a** (`generate-post-data`), the returned per-channel object (e.g. `instagramPost`) **is** the content object — pass its caption/text through as-is, but first: (1) if its `mediaWrapper.media[].url` is on a temp/external host, run it through Media Manager import (STEP 3) and replace the URL with the resulting `static.wixstatic.com` one; (2) **add the channel-specific IDs generation can't know**, from the STEP 4b account object per the field-path table: `authorId` (LinkedIn), `pageId` (Facebook), `boardId` (Pinterest), `locationId` (GBP), `channelId` (YouTube), and `privacyLevel` (TikTok). The generated payload never includes these, the draft is accepted without them, and publishing then fails (e.g. LinkedIn rejects the post: `/author :: field is required`).
- Otherwise, build it from the STEP 3 table row for your channel + `type`: the text field (`caption` for Instagram/Facebook/LinkedIn/X, `description` for YouTube/Pinterest/GBP/TikTok), the media (`mediaWrapper`, or `imageUrl`/`videoUrl` for a single item), and any channel-specific IDs from the STEP 4b account object, plus `title` where the channel uses one.
- Instagram and story types require media.

**Attribution (always set this).** Set `item.consumerInfo` to `{ "name": "wix-skills-social" }` on **every** create-draft call, for every channel. `consumerInfo.name` identifies what created the post — the Social Media Marketing dashboard sets `social-marketing`, and this recipe sets `wix-skills-social`. Set it on the draft: `name` is applied on creation only, and Update Item ignores it.

**Idempotency (retry safety).** Set a stable, caller-defined `item.referenceId` on the draft. The Publisher enforces its uniqueness — a second item created/published with the same `referenceId` is rejected with `REFERENCE_ID_ALREADY_EXIST` instead of posting a duplicate. So if a create or publish call times out, retry with the **same** `referenceId` rather than risk double-posting.

**Example — Instagram image post:**

```json
{
  "item": {
    "channel": { "name": "INSTAGRAM", "accountId": "17841405822304914" },
    "type": "POST",
    "consumerInfo": { "name": "wix-skills-social" },
    "instagramPost": {
      "imageUrl": "https://static.wixstatic.com/media/cf2434_4b3a2d8eb7f54bc89c0d4524430a2af3~mv2.jpg",
      "caption": "Summer collection just dropped! Shop the look now. #summerstyle #newarrivals"
    }
  }
}
```

For multiple media, use `mediaWrapper` instead of `imageUrl`/`videoUrl`:

```json
"instagramPost": { "mediaWrapper": { "media": [{ "type": "IMAGE", "url": "https://static.wixstatic.com/media/....jpg" }] }, "caption": "..." }
```

**Example — Facebook image post** (`accountId` = `facebook.id`, `pageId` = `facebook.page.id`, from STEP 4b):

```json
{
  "item": {
    "channel": { "name": "FACEBOOK", "accountId": "1022334455667788" },
    "type": "POST",
    "facebookPost": {
      "pageId": "102938475610293",
      "imageUrl": "https://static.wixstatic.com/media/cf2434_4b3a2d8eb7f54bc89c0d4524430a2af3~mv2.jpg",
      "caption": "Summer sale is on — 20% off all handmade ceramic mugs this week!"
    }
  }
}
```

**Example — TikTok photo post** (needs `privacyLevel` from `tiktok.privacyLevelOptions`; `description` is the text field):

```json
{
  "item": {
    "channel": { "name": "TIKTOK", "accountId": "7c9f0a12-4e6d-4a8b-9c3f-2d5e1a7b0c94" },
    "type": "POST",
    "tiktokPhoto": {
      "title": "Summer sale",
      "description": "20% off handmade ceramic mugs this week ☀️ #ceramics #handmade",
      "privacyLevel": "PUBLIC_TO_EVERYONE",
      "mediaWrapper": { "media": [{ "type": "IMAGE", "url": "https://static.wixstatic.com/media/cf2434_4b3a2d8eb7f54bc89c0d4524430a2af3~mv2.jpg" }] }
    }
  }
}
```

**Example — YouTube video** (`channelId` = `youtube.id` from STEP 4b; user brings the `videoUrl` — 2a can't generate YouTube content):

```json
{
  "item": {
    "channel": { "name": "YOUTUBE", "accountId": "UC_x5XG1OV2P6uZZ5FSM9Ttw" },
    "type": "VIDEO",
    "youtubeVideo": {
      "channelId": "UC_x5XG1OV2P6uZZ5FSM9Ttw",
      "title": "Summer collection behind the scenes",
      "description": "A look at how we make our handmade ceramic mugs.",
      "videoUrl": "https://video.wixstatic.com/video/cf2434_.../mp4/file.mp4"
    }
  }
}
```

**Expected response** (abridged) — save `id`:

```json
{ "item": { "id": "ac01c174-5244-49df-8085-84d87cd0345a", "status": "DRAFT", "channel": { "name": "INSTAGRAM", "accountId": "17841405822304914" }, "type": "POST" } }
```

## STEP 7: Publish now or schedule

Only offer scheduling if `SCHEDULE_POST` was `enabled: true` in STEP 5 (per that step's decision point); otherwise publish now is the only option.

The user already approved this exact content in STEP 3, so publish what was approved — don't regenerate. Publishing immediately is public and can't be undone (you can only delete the post afterward); if anything about the content changed since the STEP 3 approval, re-confirm before this call.

**API Endpoint:** `POST https://www.wixapis.com/social-publisher/v1/publish-by-id`

**Publish immediately** — omit `scheduledDate`:

```json
{ "id": "ac01c174-5244-49df-8085-84d87cd0345a" }
```

**Schedule for a future date** — include `scheduledDate` (ISO 8601, **must be strictly in the future**; confirm `SCHEDULE_POST` in STEP 5). Resolve the user's relative wording ("next Monday 9am", "today at 9") as a wall-clock time in the site's timezone if known, otherwise UTC, then convert that to an ISO instant. **Immediately before `publish-by-id`, validate `new Date(scheduledDate).getTime() > Date.now()`** — wording like "today at 9am" easily resolves to an instant that has already passed. If it isn't strictly in the future, don't send it: advance to the next matching future occurrence (e.g. tomorrow at 9am) or ask the user to confirm a later time. For a series of scheduled posts, compute and validate **each** occurrence independently. Confirm the resolved date(s) with the user:

```json
{ "id": "ac01c174-5244-49df-8085-84d87cd0345a", "scheduledDate": "<future-ISO-8601-datetime>" }
```

**X (Twitter) cutoff.** X is no longer functional after **July 31, 2026**. Don't publish to X once that date has passed, and don't schedule an X post with a `scheduledDate` after it — a post scheduled to fire past the cutoff won't be published.

**Expected response:** the item with an updated `status`:
- `PUBLISHED` — live on the channel; `externalItemUrl` links to the post.
- `SCHEDULED` — will publish automatically at `scheduledDate`.
- `PROCESSING` — publishing in progress; final status follows asynchronously.
- `FAILED` — publishing failed; surface the error.

(The full `status` set is `DRAFT`, `SCHEDULED`, `PROCESSING`, `IN_QUEUE`, `PUBLISHED`, `CANCELED`, `FAILED`, `DELETED`.)

The post appears on the site's Social Media Marketing page in the dashboard. To reschedule a `SCHEDULED` item, call `POST https://www.wixapis.com/social-publisher/v1/items/{id}/reschedule` with body `{ "scheduledDate": "<new-date>" }` (the item moves to `SCHEDULED` at the new date). To cancel it, call `PATCH https://www.wixapis.com/social-publisher/v1/items/{id}/cancel` with an empty body `{}` (the item moves to `CANCELED`).

## Error handling

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| STEP 4a `long-lived-token-status` returns `NEVER_CREATED` / `DISCONNECTED` / `INVALID` | Channel not connected (or connection expired) | Offer STEP 4c to connect/reconnect; **don't** call `List Accounts` for this channel — status already told you there's no user |
| STEP 4b returns empty `accounts` even though status was `VALID` | Token exists but no postable page/account was granted at authorization | Treat as not-connected for that channel; re-run STEP 4c and tell the user to grant the Page |
| `400 USER_NOT_EXIST_FOR_CHANNEL` on List Accounts | The **queried channel** has no connected user. Shouldn't occur after a `VALID` status (STEP 4a gates this) — a stray one means it disconnected between calls | Treat as not-connected for that channel only; offer STEP 4c. Don't conclude the whole site has no connected accounts — the check is per-channel |
| `428 INELIGIBLE_FOR_FEATURE` on Get Connect Url | Site has hit its plan's cap on **number of connected channels** (e.g. free = 1), not a channel-specific block | Explain the channel-count limit; offer to upgrade, or find the already-connected channel (List Accounts / ask) and offer to post there. Don't suggest connecting a *different* new channel (same cap), don't suggest disconnecting/switching, don't retry the connect flow |
| `FAILED_PRECONDITION` / `NO_PAGES_FOR_USER` on List Accounts | Connected Facebook/Instagram user has no page with a linked postable account | Ask the owner to grant a Facebook page (with a linked Instagram Business/Creator account) during authorization, then retry |
| Publish fails on a missing account-derived ID (e.g. LinkedIn `/author :: field is required`) | The `authorId`/`pageId`/`boardId`/`locationId`/`channelId`/`privacyLevel` wasn't added to the content object | Read it from the STEP 4b account object per the field-path table and add it before publishing |
| Generate Image poll returns `404 GENERATED_IMAGE_NOT_FOUND` | `executionId` invalid or expired | Re-run Generate Image and poll the new `executionId` |
| STEP 5 shows the publish/schedule feature `enabled: false` or `remainingUsage: 0` | Plan doesn't allow the action, or quota used up | Advise upgrading, or wait for quota reset |
| `FAILED_PRECONDITION` / `INELIGIBLE_FOR_FEATURE` on publish or schedule | Plan doesn't cover the action, or its quota is 0/exhausted (see the `quotaInfo` from STEP 5) | Don't retry; offer the other action if enabled (schedule vs publish now), or advise upgrading |
| `SCHEDULED_TIME_ALREADY_PASSED` (or a generic/HTML `400`) on schedule | The resolved `scheduledDate` is in the past — usually a relative time like "today at 9am" that resolved to a past instant | Recompute the wall-clock time in the site's timezone, validate the ISO instant is `> Date.now()`, and advance to the next future occurrence (or confirm a later time) before retrying — don't send-and-catch |
| `429 RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` / `PUBLISH_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` | Publishing rate limit hit | Back off and retry later |
| `ALREADY_EXISTS` / `REFERENCE_ID_ALREADY_EXIST` on create or publish | An item with the same `referenceId` already exists | Expected when safely retrying a create/publish that already succeeded — don't retry with a new `referenceId` |
| `FAILED_PRECONDITION` / `UNSUPPORTED_CHANNEL` | Targeting an unsupported channel, or X/Twitter after its July 31, 2026 cutoff | Use a supported channel; target X only before the cutoff |
| Create item rejected for missing media | Instagram and story types require media (GBP needs `description` and/or media) | Provide a public image/video URL (or edit one from a source image in STEP 2c) |
| Reschedule/cancel returns `ITEM_NOT_EXISTS`, `ITEM_IS_PUBLISHED`, or `ITEM_IS_DELETED` | The item can't be rescheduled/canceled in its current state | Only reschedule/cancel items still in `SCHEDULED` status |
| Publish returns `status: FAILED` | Content/type mismatch or channel rejected the post | Verify the `type` + content object match the channel's supported combination and that media URLs are public |
| An error arrives as an **HTML page** with only an HTTP status (no error code) | Some gateways render branded HTML error pages to non-browser callers, hiding the structured error | Interpret by status + endpoint: 428 on Get Connect Url = channel-count cap (handle per that row); 428 on publish/schedule = plan or quota gate. A 400 on `List Accounts` = channel not connected, but you shouldn't reach it — gate on `long-lived-token-status` (STEP 4a). Never read the page as "app not installed" or a random outage |
